To run these tests, you need at least these dependencies on the host:

1.    [bwrap](https://github.com/containers/bubblewrap/)
1.    [gdb](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/)
1.    [gnupg](https://www.gnupg.org/) >= 2.0

Then run the command

    make check

The number of tests performed depends on features enabled at configure time,
at least `--with-`/`--without-lua` and `--enable-`/`--disable-python`.
See also the [INSTALL](../INSTALL) file for more information.

To run *single tests*, you can run the commands:

    make check TESTOPTS="$NNN $MMM"

where _NNN_ and _MMM_ are the numbers of the tests to be run.

You can also select *tests by keywords* used in their description by using the command:

     make check TESTOPTS="-k $KEYWORD"

Use multiple `-k` parameters to have tests with different keywords run.
Use `-k $KEYWORD1,$KEYWORD2` to execute tests matching both _KEYWORD1_ and _KEYWORD2_.

For all available options, see the output of the command:

	./rpmtests --help

By default, tests are executed in parallel using all available cores, pass
a specific -jN value to limit.
