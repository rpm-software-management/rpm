Description: This dist-info is mock metadata for a fictional package pyreq2rpm.tests
        The important part of its contents is the requires.txt that contains
        different formats of Python requirements taken from
        https://github.com/gordonmessmer/pyreq2rpm, that are numbered as to be
        unique. The metadata is then processed through
        scripts/pythondistdeps.py and the resulting RPM requires compared to
        expected results.

        The version of the package contains the date when I converted the test
        data from upstream to this metapackage, as well as the short hash of
        the last git commit.

        From the requirements I have omitted those that are incorrect, as they
        crash the pythondistdeps.py script.
