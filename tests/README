To run these tests you need at least these dependencies on the host:

    fakechroot (https://github.com/dex4er/fakechroot/wiki)
    gdb (https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/)
    gnupg >= 2.0 (https://www.gnupg.org/)

Then run

   make check

The number of tests performed depends on enabled features at configure-time,
at least --with/without-lua and --enable/--disable-python.
See also the INSTALL file for more information.

To run single tests you can run

   make populate_testing ; ./rpmtests NNN MMM ...

where NNN and MMM are the numbers of the tests to be run. Use

      ./rpmtests -l

to get the list of available tests.
You can also select tests by keywords used in their description by using

     ./rpmtests -k KEYWORD

Use multiple -k parameters to have tests with different keywords run.
Use -k KEYWORD1,KEYWORD2 to execute tests matching both KEYWORD1 and KEYWORD2.

See

	./rpmtests --help

for more options. But be aware some (like -j) may not work properly with
the test suite unless a very restricted set of test is run.
