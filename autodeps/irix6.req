# find-requires is part of RPM, the Red Hat Package Manager.  find-requires
# reads a list of full pathnames (in a package) on stdin, and outputs all
# shared libraries the package requires to execute.
#
# NOTE: I use `:' as the delimiter (by default) between the library soname
# and any library version info.  This is because IRIX libraries (even
# system libraries) have "version information" in both the soname and the
# internal version field, so it's important to be able to separate those
# fields.  If we just used `.', we wouldn't know where the soname ends and
# the version infromation begins.
#
# On IRIX, use `elfdump -Dl' to find what libraries are required by
# an executable.  `elfdump -L' does what we need too, but it gives us more
# than we really need.
#
# Example `elfdump -Dl' output:
#
#$elfdump -Dl /usr/bin/X11/xterm
