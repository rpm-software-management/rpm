<h3>Description: DB_ENV-&gt;rep_stat</h3>
<p>The DB_ENV-&gt;rep_stat method returns the replication subsystem statistics.</p>
<p>The DB_ENV-&gt;rep_stat method creates a statistical structure of type
DB_REP_STAT and copies a pointer to it into a user-specified memory
location.</p>
<p>Statistical structures are stored in allocated memory.  If application-specific allocation
routines have been declared (see <a href="../api_c/env_set_alloc.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_alloc</a> for more
information), they are used to allocate the memory; otherwise, the
standard C library <b>malloc</b>(3) is used.  The caller is
responsible for deallocating the memory.  To deallocate the memory, free
the memory reference; references inside the returned memory need not be
individually freed.</p>
<p>The following DB_REP_STAT fields will be filled in:</p>
<dl compact>
<dt>u_int32_t st_bulk_fills;<dd>The number of times the bulk buffer filled up, forcing the buffer content
to be sent.
<dt>u_int32_t st_bulk_overflows;<dd>The number of times a record was bigger than the entire bulk buffer,
and therefore had to be sent as a singleton.
<dt>u_int32_t st_bulk_records;<dd>The number of records added to a bulk buffer.
<dt>u_int32_t st_bulk_transfers;<dd>The number of bulk buffers transferred (via a call to the
application's <b>send</b> function).
<dt>u_int32_t st_client_rerequests;<dd>The number of times this client site received a "re-request" message,

<b>st_client_svc_miss</b>.)
<dt>u_int32_t st_client_svc_miss;<dd>The number of "request" type messages received by this client that
could not be processed, forcing the originating requester to try sending
the request to the master (or another client).
<dt>u_int32_t st_client_svc_req;<dd>The number of "request" type messages received by this client.
("Request" messages are usually sent from a client to the master, but a
message marked with the <a href="../api_c/rep_transport.html#DB_REP_ANYWHERE">DB_REP_ANYWHERE</a> flag in the invocation
of the application's <b>send</b> function may be sent to another client
instead.)

<dt>u_int32_t st_election_tiebreaker;<dd>The election tiebreaker value.
<dt>u_int32_t st_election_usec;<dd>The number of microseconds the last election took (the total election
time is <b>st_election_sec</b> plus <b>st_election_usec</b>).
<dt>u_int32_t st_election_votes;<dd>The number of votes received in the last election.
<dt>u_int32_t st_elections;<dd>The number of elections held.
<dt>u_int32_t st_elections_won;<dd>The number of elections won.
