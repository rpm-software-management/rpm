<h3>Description: Db::stat</h3>
<p>The Db::stat method creates a statistical structure and
copies a pointer to it into user-specified memory locations.
Specifically, if <b>sp</b> is non-NULL, a pointer to the statistics
for the database are copied into the memory location to which it refers.</p>
<p>Statistical structures are stored in allocated memory.  If application-specific allocation
routines have been declared (see <a href="../api_cxx/env_set_alloc.html">DbEnv::set_alloc</a> for more
information), they are used to allocate the memory; otherwise, the
standard C library <b>malloc</b>(3) is used.  The caller is
responsible for deallocating the memory.  To deallocate the memory, free
the memory reference; references inside the returned memory need not be
individually freed.</p>
<p>If the DB_FAST_STAT flag has not been specified, the
Db::stat method will access some of or all the pages in the database,
incurring a severe performance penalty as well as possibly flushing the
underlying buffer pool.</p>
<p>In the presence of multiple threads or processes accessing an active
database, the information returned by Db::stat may be out-of-date.</p>
<p>If the database was not opened read-only and the DB_FAST_STAT
flag was not specified, the cached key and record numbers will be
updated after the statistical information has been gathered.</p>
<p>The Db::stat method cannot be transaction-protected.  For this reason,
it should be called in a thread of control that has no open cursors or
active transactions.</p>
<p>The Db::stat method
either returns a non-zero error value
or throws an exception that encapsulates a non-zero error value on
failure, and returns 0 on success.
</p>
<h3>Hash Statistics</h3>
<p>In the case of a Hash database,
the statistics are stored in a structure of type DB_HASH_STAT.  The
following fields will be filled in:</p>
<p><dl compact>
<dt>u_int32_t hash_magic;<dd>Magic number that identifies the file as a Hash file.  Returned if
DB_FAST_STAT is set.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_version;<dd>The version of the Hash database.  Returned if DB_FAST_STAT is
set.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_nkeys;<dd>The number of unique keys in the database.  If DB_FAST_STAT was
specified the count will be the last saved value unless it has never
been calculated, in which case it will be 0. Returned if
DB_FAST_STAT is set.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_ndata;<dd>The number of key/data pairs in the database.  If DB_FAST_STAT
was specified the count will be the last saved value unless it has never
been calculated, in which case it will be 0. Returned if
DB_FAST_STAT is set.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_pagesize;<dd>The underlying Hash database page (and bucket) size, in bytes.
Returned if DB_FAST_STAT is set.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_ffactor;<dd>The desired fill factor (number of items per bucket) specified at

<dt>u_int32_t hash_bigpages;<dd>The number of big key/data pages.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_big_bfree;<dd>The number of bytes free on big item pages.
<dt>u_int32_t hash_overflows;<dd>The number of overflow pages (overflow pages are pages that contain items
that did not fit in the main bucket page).
<dt>u_int32_t hash_ovfl_free;<dd>The number of bytes free on overflow pages.

is set.
<dt>u_int32_t bt_nkeys;<dd>For the Btree Access Method, the number of unique keys in the database.
If DB_FAST_STAT was specified and the database was created with
the <a href="../api_cxx/db_set_flags.html#DB_RECNUM">DB_RECNUM</a> flag, the count will be exact, otherwise, the
count will be the last saved value unless it has never been calculated,

database.  If DB_FAST_STAT was specified the count will be the
last saved value unless it has never been calculated, in which case it
will be 0.  For the Recno Access Method, the exact number of records in
the database. If the database has been configured to not renumber
records during deletion, the count of records will only reflect
undeleted records.  Returned if DB_FAST_STAT is set.

DB_FAST_STAT is set.

<h3>Parameters</h3>
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><b>flags</b><dd>
The <b>flags</b> parameter must be set to 0 or
one of the following values:
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt><a name="DB_FAST_STAT">DB_FAST_STAT</a><dd>Return only the values which do not require traversal of the database.
<p>Among other things, this flag makes it possible for applications to
request key and record counts without incurring the performance penalty
of traversing the entire database.  If the underlying database is of
type Recno, or of type Btree and the database was created with the
<a href="../api_cxx/db_set_flags.html#DB_RECNUM">DB_RECNUM</a> flag, the count of keys will be exact.  Otherwise,
the count of keys will be the value saved the last time the database
was traversed, or 0 if no count of keys has ever been made.  If the
underlying database is of type Recno, the count of data items will be
exact, otherwise, the count of data items will be the value saved the
last time the database was traversed, or 0 if no count of data items
has ever been done.</p>
</dl>
</dl>
<h3>Errors</h3>
<p>The Db::stat method
may fail and throw
<a href="../api_cxx/except_class.html">DbException</a>,
encapsulating one of the following non-zero errors, or return one of
the following non-zero errors:</p>
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>DB_REP_HANDLE_DEAD<dd>The database handle has been invalidated because a replication election
unrolled a committed transaction.
</dl>
<p><dl compact>
<p><dt>EINVAL<dd>An
invalid flag value or parameter was specified.
