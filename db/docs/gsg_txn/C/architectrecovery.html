            When building your DB application, you should consider how you will run recovery. If you are building a
            single threaded, single process application, it is fairly simple to run recovery when your application first
            opens its environment. In this case, you need only decide if you want to run recovery every time you open
            your application (recommended) or only some of the time, presumably triggered by a start up option
            controlled by your application's user.
        </p>
      <p>
            However, for multi-threaded and multi-process applications, you need to carefully consider how you will
            design your application's startup code so as to run recovery only when it makes sense to do so.
        </p>

                If your application uses only one environment handle, then handling recovery for a multi-threaded
                application is no more difficult than for a single threaded application. You simply open the environment
                in the application's main thread, and then pass that handle to each of the threads that will be
                performing DB operations. We illustrate this with our final example in this book (see 
                <a href="txnexample_c.html">Transaction Example</a>
                
                
                
                for more information).
            </p>
        <p>
                Alternatively, you can have each worker thread open its own environment handle. However, in this case,
                designing for recovery is a bit more complicated. 
            </p>
        <p>
                Generally, when a thread performing database operations fails
                or hangs, it is frequently best to simply
                restart the application and run recovery upon application
                startup as normal. However, not all applications can afford
                to restart because a single thread has misbehaved. 
             </p>
        <p>
                If you are attempting to continue operations in the face of a misbehaving thread,
                then at a minimum recovery must be run if a thread performing database operations fails or hangs.
            </p>
        <p>
                Remember that recovery clears the environment of all
                outstanding locks, including any that might be outstanding
                from an aborted thread. If these locks are not cleared,
                other threads performing database operations can back up
                behind the locks obtained but never cleared by the failed
                thread. The result will be an application that hangs
                indefinitely.
            </p>
        <p>
                To run recovery under these circumstances:
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                        Suspend or shutdown all other threads performing
                        database operations.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        Discarding any open environment handles. Note that
                        attempting to gracefully close these handles may be
                        asking for trouble; the close can fail if the
                        environment is already in need of recovery. For
                        this reason, it is best and easiest to simply discard the handle.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        Open new handles, running recovery as you open
                        them.
                        See <a href="recovery.html#normalrecovery">Normal Recovery</a> for more information.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        Restart all your database threads.
                    </p>
            </li>
          </ol>
        </div>
        <p>
                A traditional way to handle this activity is to spawn a watcher thread that is responsible for making
                sure all is well with your threads, and performing the above actions if not.
            </p>
        <p>
                However, in the case where each worker thread opens and maintains its own environment handle, recovery
                is complicated for two reasons:
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                        For some applications and workloads, it might be
                        worthwhile to give your database threads the
                        ability to gracefully finalize any on-going
                        transactions. If this is the case, your
                        code must be capable of signaling each thread 
                        to halt DB activities and close its
                        environment. If you simply run recovery against the
                        environment, your database threads will
                        detect this and fail in the midst of performing their
                        database operations.
                    </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                        Your code must be capable of ensuring only one
                        thread runs recovery before allowing all other
                        threads to open their respective environment
                        handles. Recovery should be single threaded because when
                        recovery is run against an environment, it is
                        deleted and then recreated. This will cause all
                        other processes and threads to "fail" when they
                        attempt operations against the newly recovered
                        environment. If all threads run recovery
                        when they start up, then it is likely that some
                        threads will fail because the environment that they
                        are using has been recovered. This will cause the thread to have to re-execute its own recovery
                        path. At best, this is inefficient and at worst it could cause your application to fall into an
                        endless recovery pattern.

                Frequently, DB applications use multiple processes to interact with the databases. For example, you may
                have a long-running process, such as some kind of server, and then a series of administrative tools that
                you use to inspect and administer the underlying databases. Or, in some web-based architectures, different
                services are run as independent processes that are managed by the server.
            </p>
        <p>
                In any case, recovery for a multi-process environment is complicated for two reasons:
            </p>
        <div class="orderedlist">
          <ol type="1">
            <li>
              <p>
                        In the event that recovery must be run, you might
                        want to notify processes interacting with the environment 
                        that recovery is about to occur and give them a
                        chance to gracefully terminate. Whether it is
                        worthwhile for you to do this is entirely dependent
                        upon the nature of your application. Some
                        long-running applications with multiple processes
                        performing meaningful work might want to do this.
                        Other applications with processes performing database 
                        operations that are likely to be harmed by error conditions in other
                        processes will likely find it to be not worth the
                        effort. For this latter group, the chances of
                        performing a graceful shutdown may be low anyway.

              <p>
                        Unlike single process scenarios, it can quickly become wasteful for every process interacting
                        with the databases to run recovery when it starts up. This is partly because recovery
                        <span class="emphasis"><em>does</em></span> take some amount of time to run, but mostly you want to 
                        avoid a situation where your server must
                        reopen all its environment handles just because you fire up a command line database
                        administrative utility that always runs recovery.

                DB offers you two methods by which you can manage recovery for multi-process DB applications.
                Each has different strengths and weaknesses, and they are described in the next sections.

                    Before continuing, it is worth noting that the following sections describe recovery processes than
                    can result in one process running recovery while other processes are currently actively performing 
                    database operations. 
                </p>
          <p>
                    When this happens, the current database operation will
                    abnormally fail, indicating a DB_RUNRECOVERY condition.
                    This means that your application should immediately abandon any database operations that it may have
                    on-going, discard any environment handles it has opened, and obtain and open new handles. 
                </p>
          <p>
                    The net effect of this is that any writes performed by unresolved transactions will be lost.
                    For persistent applications (servers, for example), the services it provides will also be
                    unavailable for the amount of time that it takes to complete a recovery and for all participating
                    processes to reopen their environment handles.

                    One way to handle multi-process recovery is for every process to "register" its environment. In
                    doing so, the process gains the ability to see if any other applications are using the
                    environment and, if so, whether they have suffered an abnormal termination. If an abnormal
                    termination is detected, the process runs recovery; otherwise, it does not.
                </p>
          <p>
                    Note that using process registration also ensures that
                    recovery is serialized across applications. That is,
                    only one process at a time has a chance to run
                    recovery. Generally this means that the first process
                    to start up will run recovery, and all other processes
                    will silently not run recovery because it is not
                    needed.
                </p>
          <p>
                    To cause your application to register its environment, you specify
                        <span>
                            the <tt class="literal">DB_REGISTER</tt> flag when you open your environment.
                            Note that you must also specify <tt class="literal">DB_RECOVER</tt> or 
                            <tt class="literal">DB_RECOVER_FATAL</tt> for your environment open.
                        </span>

                        
                        If during the open, DB determines that recovery must be run, this indicates the type of
                        recovery that is run. If you do not specify either type of recovery, then no recovery is run if
                        the registration process identifies a need for it. In this case, the environment open simply
                        fails by 
                            <span>returning <tt class="literal">DB_RUNRECOVERY</tt>.</span>
                            
                </p>
          <p>
                    Be aware that there are some limitations/requirements if you want your various processes to
                    coordinate recovery using this registration process:
                </p>
          <div class="orderedlist">
            <ol type="1">
              <li>
                <p>
                            There can be only one environment handle per
                            environment per process. In the case of multi-threaded
                            processes, the environment handle must be shared across threads.
                        </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                            All processes sharing the environment must use registration. If registration is
                            not uniformly used across all participating processes, then you can see inconsistent results 
                            in terms of your application's ability to recognize that recovery must be run.

                    processes are working as intended is to make use of a watchdog process. To assist a watchdog
                    process, DB offers a failure checking mechanism.
                </p>
          <p>
                    When a thread of control fails with open environment handles, the result is that there may be
                    resources left locked or corrupted. Other threads of control may encountered these unavailable resources 
                    quickly or not at all, depending on data access patterns.
                </p>
          <p>
                    In any case, the DB failure checking mechanism allows a watchdog to detect if an environment is 
                    unusable as a result of a thread of control failure. It should be called periodically 
                    (for example, once a minute) from the watchdog process. If the environment is deemed unusable, then
                    the watchdog process is notified that recovery should be run. It is then up to the watchdog to
                    actually run recovery. It is also the watchdog's responsibility to decide what to do about currently
                    running processes before running recovery. The watchdog could, for example, attempt to
                    gracefully shutdown or kill all relevant processes before running recovery.
                </p>
          <p>
                    Note that failure checking need not be run from a separate process, although conceptually that is
                    how the mechanism is meant to be used. This same mechanism could be used in a multi-threaded
                    application that wants to have a watchdog thread.
                </p>
          <p>
                    To use failure checking you must:
                </p>
          <div class="orderedlist">
            <ol type="1">
              <li>
                <p> 
                            <span>
                                Provide an <tt class="function">is_alive()</tt> call back using the 
                                <tt class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;set_isalive()</tt> 
                                 
                                method. 
                            </span>
                            
                                DB uses this method to determine whether a specified process and thread
                                is alive when the failure checking is performed.
                        </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                            Possibly provide a 
                            
                                <span>
                                <tt class="literal">thread_id</tt> callback 
                                </span>
                                
                                
                                
                            that uniquely identifies a process
                            and thread of control. This 
                                <span>callback</span>
                                
                            is only necessary if the standard process and thread
                            identification functions for your platform are not sufficient to for use by failure
                            checking. This is rarely necessary and is usually because the thread and/or process ids 
                            used by your system cannot fit into an unsigned integer. 
                        </p>
                <p>
                            You provide this callback using the
                                <tt class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;set_thread_id()</tt>
                                
                            method. See the API reference for this method for more information on when setting a thread
                            id callback might be necessary.
                        </p>
              </li>
              <li>
                <p>
                            Call the 
                                <tt class="methodname">DB_ENV-&gt;failchk()</tt>
                                
                                
                            method periodically. You can do this either periodically (once per minute, for example), or
                            whenever a thread of control exits for your application.
                        </p>
                <p>
                            If this method determines that a thread of control exited holding read locks, those locks
                            are automatically released. If the thread of control exited with an unresolved transaction,
                            that transaction is aborted. If any other problems exist beyond these such that the
                            environment must be recovered, the method will
                                <span>return <tt class="literal">DB_RUNRECOVERY</tt>.</span>
                                
                        </p>
              </li>
            </ol>
          </div>
          <p>
                    Note that this mechanism should not be mixed with the process registration method of multi-process
                    recovery described in the previous section.
