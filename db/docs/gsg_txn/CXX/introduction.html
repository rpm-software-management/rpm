    This book provides a thorough introduction and discussion on transactions as
    used with Berkeley DB (DB). It begins by offering a general overview to
    transactions, the guarantees they provide, and the general application
    infrastructure required to obtain full transactional protection for your
    data. 
  </p>
      <p>
    This book also provides detailed examples on how to write a
    transactional application. Both single threaded and multi-threaded <span>(as well as multi-process
    applications)</span> are discussed. A detailed description of various
    backup and recovery strategies is included in this manual, as is a
    discussion on performance considerations for your transactional application.
  </p>
      <p>

        Transactions offer your application's data protection from
        application or system failures.  That is, DB transactions offer 
        your application full ACID support:
    </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul type="disc">
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="bold"><b>A</b></span>tomicity
            </p>
              <p>
                Multiple database operations are treated as a single unit of
                work.  Once committed, all write operations performed under 
                the protection of the transaction are saved to your databases.
                Further, in the event that you abort a transaction, all write
                operations performed during the transaction are discarded.
                In this event, your database is left in the state it was in
                before the transaction began, regardless of the number or
                type of write operations you may have performed during the
                course of the transaction.
            </p>
              <p>
                Note that DB transactions can span one or more
                database handles. 
            </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                <span class="bold"><b>C</b></span>onsistency
            </p>
              <p>
                Your databases will never see a partially completed
                transaction. This is true even if your application fails while there are
                in-progress transactions. If the application or system fails,
                then either all of the database changes appear when the
                application next runs, or none of them appear.
            </p>
              <p>
                In other words, whatever consistency requirements your application has will never be violated by DB.
                If, for example, your application requires every record to include an employee ID, and your
                code faithfully adds that ID to its database records, then DB will never
                violate that consistency requirement. The ID will remain in the database records until such a time as your
                application chooses to delete it.
            </p>
            </li>

                <span class="bold"><b>I</b></span>solation
            </p>
              <p>
                While a transaction is in progress, your databases will appear
                to the transaction as if there are no other operations 
                occurring outside of the transaction. That is, operations
                wrapped inside a transaction will always have a clean and
                consistent view of your databases. They never have to see
                updates currently in progress under the protection of another transaction. 
                Note, however, that isolation guarantees can be 
                
                 relaxed from the default setting.   See 
                <a href="isolation.html">Isolation</a>
                for more information.

            </p>
              <p>
                Once committed to your databases, your modifications will
                persist even in the event of an application or system failure.
                Note that like isolation, your durability guarantee can be
                relaxed. See <a href="usingtxns.html#nodurabletxn">Non-Durable Transactions</a>

            From time to time this manual mentions that transactions protect your data against 'system or application 
            failure.' This is
            true up to a certain extent. However, not all failures are created equal and no data protection 
            mechanism can protect you against every conceivable way a computing system can find to die.
        </p>
          <p>
            Generally, when this book talks about protection against failures, it means that 
            transactions offer protection against
            the likeliest culprits for system and application crashes. So long as your data modifications have been
            committed to disk, those modifications should persist even if your application or OS subsequently fails.
            And, even if the application or OS fails in the middle of a transaction commit (or abort), the data on disk
            should be either in a consistent state, or there should be enough data available to bring 
            your databases into a consistent state (via a recovery procedure, for example). You may, however, 
            lose whatever data you were committing at the
            time of the failure, but your databases will be otherwise unaffected.
        </p>
          <div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;">
            <h3 class="title">Note</h3>
            <p>
                    Be aware that many disks have a disk write cache and on
                    some systems it is enabled by default.  This means that
                    a transaction can have committed, and to your
                    application the data may appear to reside on disk, but
                    the data may in fact reside only in the write cache at
                    that time. This means that if the disk write cache is
                    enabled and there is no battery backup for it, data can
                    be lost after an OS crash even when maximum durability
                    mode is in use.  For maximum durability, disable the
                    disk write cache or use a disk write cache with a
                    battery backup.
                </p>
          </div>
          <p>
            Of course, if your <span class="emphasis"><em>disk</em></span> fails, then the transactional benefits described in this book
            are only as good as the backups you have taken. 


            <span>
                By spreading your data and log files across separate disks,
                you can minimize the risk of data loss due to a disk failure, but even in this case it is possible to
                conjure a scenario where even this protection is insufficient (a fire in the machine room, for example) and
                you must go to your backups for protection.
            </span>
        </p>
          <p>
            Finally, by following the programming examples shown in this book, you can write your code so as to protect
            your data in the event that your code crashes. However, no programming API can protect you against logic
            failures in your own code; transactions cannot protect you from simply writing the wrong thing to your
            databases.

            In order to use transactions, your application has certain
            requirements beyond what is required of non-transactional protected
            applications.  They are:
        </p>
          <div class="itemizedlist">
            <ul type="disc">
              <li>
                <p>
                    Environments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Environments are optional for non-transactional
                    applications, but they are required for transactional
                    applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Environment usage is described in detail in 
                    <a href="usingtxns.html">Transaction Basics</a>.
                </p>

                    Transaction subsystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to use transactions, you must explicitly
                    enable the transactional subsystem for your
                    application, and this must be done at the time that
                    your environment is first created. 
                </p>
              </li>

                    Logging subsystem.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The logging subsystem is required for recovery purposes, but
                    its usage also means your application may require a
                    little more administrative effort than it does when logging
                    is not in use. See <a href="filemanagement.html">Managing DB Files</a> for more information.

                    handles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In order to obtain the atomicity guarantee offered by
                    the transactional subsystem (that is, combine multiple
                    operations in a single unit of work), your application must use
                    transaction handles.  These handles are obtained from your 
                    
                    <span>DbEnv</span>
                    
                    
                    objects. They should normally be short-lived, and their usage is 
                    reasonably simple. To complete a transaction and save
                    the work it performed, you 
                    call its <tt class="methodname">commit()</tt> method. To
                    complete a transaction and discard its work, you call its
                    <tt class="methodname">abort()</tt> method.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In addition, it is possible to use auto commit if you want
                    to transactional protect a single write operation. Auto
                    commit allows a transaction to be used without 
                    obtaining an explicit transaction handle. See 
                    <a href="autocommit.html">Auto Commit</a>
                    for information on how to use auto commit.

                    if subsequent operations on the databases are to be transaction
                    protected. The database open and secondary index
                    association are commonly transaction protected using
                    auto commit.

                <p>
                    Deadlock detection.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Typically transactional applications use multiple
                    threads of control when accessing the database. Any
                    time multiple threads are used on a single resource,
                    the potential for lock contention arises. In turn, lock
                    contention can lead to deadlocks. See
                    <a href="blocking_deadlocks.html">Locks, Blocks, and Deadlocks</a>
                    for more information.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Therefore, transactional applications must frequently
                    include code for detecting and responding to deadlocks.
                    Note that this requirement is not
                    <span class="emphasis"><em>specific</em></span> to transactions
                    – you can certainly write concurrent
                    non-transactional DB applications. Further, not
                    every transactional application uses concurrency and
                    so not every transactional application must
                    manage deadlocks. Still, deadlock management is so
                    frequently a characteristic of transactional
                    applications that we discuss it in this
                    book. See <a href="txnconcurrency.html">Concurrency</a>

            DB is designed to support multi-threaded  <span>and
            multi-process</span> applications, but their usage means
            you must pay careful attention to issues of concurrency.
            Transactions help your application's concurrency by providing various levels of
            isolation for your threads of control. In addition, DB
            provides mechanisms that allow you to detect and respond to
            deadlocks (but strictly speaking, this is not limited to just
            transactional applications).
        </p>
          <p>
            <span class="emphasis"><em>Isolation</em></span> means that database modifications made by
            one transaction will not normally be seen by readers from another
            transaction until the first commits its changes.  Different threads 
            use different transaction handles, so
            this mechanism is normally used to provide isolation between
            database operations performed by different threads.
        </p>
          <p>
            Note that DB supports different isolation levels. For example,
            you can configure your application to see uncommitted reads, which means
            that one transaction can see data that has been modified but not yet
            committed by another transaction. Doing this might mean your
            transaction reads data "dirtied" by another transaction, 
            but which subsequently might change before that
            other transaction commits its changes.
            On the other hand, lowering your isolation
            requirements means that your application can experience
            improved throughput due to reduced lock contention.
