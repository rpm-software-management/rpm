<h3 align=center>Building for BREW</h3>
<p>This page has general instructions for building the Berkeley DB library
and applets for the BREW platform.</p>
<h3>Building Berkeley DB for the BREW simulator</h3>
<p>The <b>build_brew</b> directory in the Berkeley DB distribution contains
project files for Microsoft Visual C++:</p>
<table border=1 align=center>
<tr><th>Project File</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>    <td align=left>bdb_brew.dsw</td>    <td align=left>Visual C++ 6.0 workspace</td>    </tr>
<tr>    <td align=left>bdb_brew.dsp</td>    <td align=left>Visual C++ 6.0 project</td>    </tr>
</table>
<p>The project file can be used to build the Berkeley DB library for the BREW
platform. Both BREW SDK versions 2 and 3 are supported.  By default, the
build is for BREW SDK version 2.</p>
<p>The steps for building the Berkeley DB library for the BREW Simulator are as
follows:</p>
<ol>
<p><li>Install the BREW SDK and BREW SDK Tools.
<p><li>To build for BREW SDK version 3, edit the Berkeley DB source distribution file
<b>build_brew/db_config.h</b> file and <b>remove</b> the line
"#define HAVE_BREW_SDK2".  No changes are required to build for BREW SDK
version 2.
<p><li>Select <i>File -&gt; Open Workspace</i>.  Look in the build_brew
directory for Workspaces, select <i>bdb_brew.dsw</i>, and select
<i>Open</i>.
<p><li>The BREW SDK creates an environment entry "BREWDIR" after the SDK
installation. Confirm the entry exists, and if not, create an
environment entry which points to the BREW SDK's root directory.
<p><li>For the BREW platform, only the project "bdb_brew" is available.  Set
the bdb_brew project as the active project and select the appropriate
option for the build_all project (Debug or Release). Then select
<i>OK</i>.
<p><li>To build, press F7.
</ol>
<p>The build results are placed in a subdirectory of build_brew named after
the selected configuration (for example, <b>build_brew\Release</b> or
<b>build_brew\Debug</b>).</p>
<p>When building the application during development, you should normally
use compile options "Debug Multithreaded DLL" and link against
<b>build_brew\Debug\bdb_brew.lib</b>. You can also build using a
release version of the Berkeley DB libraries and tools, which will be placed
in <b>build_brew\Release\bdb_brew.lib</b>. When linking against the
release build, you should compile your code with the "Release
Multithreaded DLL" compile option. You will also need to add the
<b>build_brew</b> directory to the list of include directories of your
application's project, or copy the Berkeley DB include files to another
location.</p>
<h3>Building a BREW applet with Berkeley DB library</h3>
<p>Building a Berkeley DB application in the BREW environment is similar to
building in a Windows environment.  Ensure that <b>db.h</b> is in the
build include path and <b>bdb_brew.lib</b> is in the build library
path (alternatively, you can add project dependencies to the
<b>bdb_brew</b> project).</p>
<p>BREW applets require a few minor additions:</p>
<ol>
<p><li>The <b>BDBApp</b> structure must be extended -- the extended
definition of BDBApp is found in the include file <b>db.h</b>.
<p><li>Before any Berkeley DB operations are performed, the applet must call the "int
brew_bdb_begin(void)" function.  This function returns 0 on success, and
non-zero on failure.
<p><li>After the last Berkeley DB operation is performed, the applet must call the
"void brew_bdb_end(void)" function.  Note that the brew_bdb_end function
cannot be called in the applet "cleanup" function.  If that is a
requirement, use the following code instead:
<blockquote><pre>BDBApp *pMe=(BDBApp *)po;
if (pMe-&gt;db_global_values != NULL)
	FREE(pMe-&gt;db_global_values);</pre></blockquote>
</ol>
<h3>Building a BREW applet for the physical device</h3>
<p>The binaries linked with the Berkeley DB library for the BREW simulator are
not target files that can run on the physical device.  In order to build
for the physical device, an ARM compiler is needed: the recommended ARM
compiler is ARM Developer Suite 1.2.</p>
<p>The steps for building a BREW applet for the physical device are as
follows:</p>
<ol>
<p><li>Set the target BREW Applet project as the active project.
<p><li>Select "Generate ARM Make file" in the BREW tool bar for VC6, and a make
file will be generated (if this step does not work, confirm your ADS was
correctly installed).
<p><li>The Berkeley DB library must then be manually added to this make file.  See the
<b>build_brew\bdbread.mak</b> file in the Berkeley DB distribution for an
example.
<p><li>Select <i>Tools -&gt; BREW Application 'Make'</i> to build.
</ol>
<p>The target .mod file will be created in the build directory, and this
is the file which should be uploaded to the physical device.</p>
