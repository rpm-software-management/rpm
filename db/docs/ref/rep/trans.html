<h1 align=center>Transactional guarantees</h1>
<p>It is important to consider replication in the context of the overall
database environment's transactional guarantees.  To briefly review,
transactional guarantees in a non-replicated application are based on
the writing of log file records to "stable storage", usually a disk
drive.  If the application or system then fails, the Berkeley DB logging
information is reviewed during recovery, and the databases are updated
so that all changes made as part of committed transactions appear, and
all changes made as part of uncommitted transactions do not appear.  In
this case, no information will have been lost.
<p>If a database environment does not require that the log be flushed to
stable storage on transaction commit (using the <a href="../../api_c/env_set_flags.html#DB_TXN_NOSYNC">DB_TXN_NOSYNC</a>
flag to increase performance at the cost of sacrificing transactional
durability), Berkeley DB recovery will only be able to restore the system to
the state of the last commit found on stable storage.  In this case,
information may have been lost (for example, the changes made by some
committed transactions may not appear in the databases after recovery).
<p>Further, if there is database or log file loss or corruption (for
example, if a disk drive fails), then catastrophic recovery is
necessary, and Berkeley DB recovery will only be able to restore the system
to the state of the last archived log file.  In this case, information
may also have been lost.
<p>Replicating the database environment extends this model, by adding a
new component to "stable storage": the client's replicated information.
If a database environment is replicated, there is no lost information
in the case of database or log file loss, because the replicated system
can be configured to contain a complete set of databases and log records
up to the point of failure.  A database environment that loses a disk
drive can have the drive replaced, and it can rejoin the replication
group as a client.
<p>Because of this new component of stable storage, specifying
<a href="../../api_c/env_set_flags.html#DB_TXN_NOSYNC">DB_TXN_NOSYNC</a> in a replicated environment no longer sacrifices
durability, as long as one or more clients have acknowledged receipt of
the messages sent by the master.  Since network connections are often
faster than local disk writes, replication becomes a way for
applications to significantly improve their performance as well as their
reliability.
<p>The return status from the <b>send</b> interface specified to the
<a href="../../api_c/rep_transport.html">DB_ENV-&gt;set_rep_transport</a> function must be set by the application to ensure the
transactional guarantees the application wants to provide.  The effect
of the <b>send</b> interface returning failure is to flush the local
database environment's log as necessary to ensure that any information
critical to database integrity is not lost.  Because this flush is an
expensive operation in terms of database performance, applications will
want to avoid returning an error from the <b>send</b> interface, unless
it is absolutely necessary.
<p>First, there is no reason for the <b>send</b> interface to ever return
failure unless the <a href="../../api_c/rep_transport.html#DB_REP_PERMANENT">DB_REP_PERMANENT</a> flag is specified.  Messages
without that flag do not make visible changes to databases, and
therefore the application's <b>send</b> interface can return success
to Berkeley DB immediately after it has sent the message (or even simply
copied the message to its local memory).
<p>Further, unless the master's database environment has been configured
to not synchronously flush the log on transaction commit, there is no
reason for the <b>send</b> interface to ever return failure, as any
information critical to database integrity has already been flushed to
the local log before <b>send</b> was called.  Again, the <b>send</b>
interface should return success to Berkeley DB as soon as possible.  However,
in such cases, in order to avoid potential loss of information after
the master database environment fails, the master database environment
should be recovered before holding an election, as only the master
database environment is guaranteed to have the most up-to-date logs.
<p>To sum up, the only reason for the <b>send</b> interface to return
failure is when the master database environment has been configured to
not synchronously flush the log on transaction commit, the
<a href="../../api_c/rep_transport.html#DB_REP_PERMANENT">DB_REP_PERMANENT</a> flag is specified, and the <b>send</b>
interface was unable to determine that some number of clients have
received the current message (and all messages preceding the current
message).  How many clients should receive the message before the
<b>send</b> interface can return success is an application choice, and,
in fact, may not depend as much on a specific number of clients
reporting success as one or more geographically distributed clients.
<p>Of course, it is important to ensure that the replicated master and
client environments are truly independent of each other.  For example,
it does not help matters that a client has acknowledged receipt of a
message if both master and clients are on the same power supply, as the
failure of the power supply will still potentially lose information.
<p>Finally, the Berkeley DB replication implementation has one other additional
feature to increase application reliability.  Replication in Berkeley DB is
implemented to perform database updates using a different code path than
the standard ones.  This means operations which manage to crash the
replication master due to a software bug will not necessarily also crash
replication clients.
