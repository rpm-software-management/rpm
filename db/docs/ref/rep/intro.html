<h1 align=center>Introduction</h1>
<p>Berkeley DB includes support for building highly available applications based
on replication.  Berkeley DB replication groups consist of some number of
independently configured database environments.  There is a single
<i>master</i> database environment and one or more <i>client</i>
database environments.  Master environments support both database reads
and writes; client environments support only database reads.  If the
master environment fails, applications may upgrade a client to be the
new master.  The database environments might be on separate computers,
on separate hardware partitions in a non-uniform memory access (NUMA)
system, or on separate disks in a single server.  As always with Berkeley DB
environments, any number of concurrent processes or threads may access
a database environment.
<p>Applications may be written to provide various degrees of consistency
between the master and clients.  The system can be run synchronously
such that replicas are guaranteed to be up-to-date with all committed
transactions, but doing so may incur a significant performance penalty.
Higher performance solutions sacrifice total consistency, allowing the
clients to be out of date for an application-controlled amount of time.
<p>While Berkeley DB includes the tools necessary to construct highly available
database environments, applications must provide several critical
components.  First, the application is responsible for providing the
communication infrastructure.  Applications may use whatever wire
protocol is appropriate for their application (for example, RPC, TCP/IP,
UDP, VI, message-passing over the backplane, etc.).  Second, the
application is responsible for naming.  Berkeley DB refers to the members of
a replication group using an application-provided ID, and applications
must map that ID to a particular database environment or communication
channel. Third, the application is responsible for monitoring the status
of the master and clients, and identifying any unavailable database
environments.  Finally, the application must provide whatever security
policies are needed.  For example, the application may choose to encrypt
data, use a secure socket layer, or do nothing at all.  The level of
security is left to the sole discretion of the application.
