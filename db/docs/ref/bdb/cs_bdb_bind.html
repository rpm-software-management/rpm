<h3 align=center>Using Data Formats and Bindings</h3>
<p align=center><img src="bind_fig_1.gif" alt="bind_fig_1">
<h3>Interfaces for defining data formats and data-to-object
bindings.</h3>
<p>Data formats determine how keys and values are represented as
stored data (byte arrays) in the database.  Data bindings determine
how stored data is converted to and from Java objects.</p>
<p>The selection of data formats and bindings is, in general,
independent of the selection of access methods and collection views.
In other words, any format and binding can be used with any access
method or collection, with one exception described under Record Numbers.</p>
<p><b>Note:</b> In this document formats and bindings are described
in the context of their use for stored data in a database.  However,
formats and bindings may also be used independently of a database.  Using
the 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/SimpleBuffer.html">SimpleBuffer</a>
 class, bindings may be
used to operate on an arbitrary byte array.  This allows using bindings
when data is to be written to a file or sent over a network, for example.
The 
<a href="cs_bdb_bind.html">com.sleepycat.bdb.bind</a>
 package has no dependencies on the
<a href="cs_bdb.html">com.sleepycat.bdb</a>
 package.</p>
<h3>Selecting Data Formats</h3>
<p>For the key and value of each data store, and for the key of each
data index, you may select one of the following formats.</p>
<table border=1 align=center>
<tr><th>Format</th><th>Ordered</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr><td>
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/serial/SerialFormat.html">SerialFormat</a>
</td><td>No</td><td>The data is stored using a compact form of Java serialization, where the
class descriptions are stored separately in a catalog data store.  Arbitrary
Java objects are supported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/tuple/TupleFormat.html">TupleFormat</a>
</td><td>Yes</td><td>The data is stored using a series of fixed length primitive values or zero terminated character arrays (strings).  Class/type evolution is not supported.</td></tr>
<tr><td>
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/RecordNumberFormat.html">RecordNumberFormat</a>
</td><td>Yes</td><td>The data is a 32-bit integer stored in a platform-dependent format.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Custom format</td><td>User-defined</td><td>The data storage format and ordering is determined by the custom
implementation.</td></tr>
</table>
<p>As shown in the table above, the tuple format supports ordering
while the serial format does not.  This means that tuples should be
used instead of serial data for keys in an ordered database.</p>
<p>The tuple format uses less space and its bindings execute faster
than the serial format.  But once a tuple is written to a database, the
order of fields in the tuple may not be changed and fields may not be
deleted.  The only type evolution allowed is the addition of fields at
the end of the tuple, and this must be explicitly supported by the
bindings.</p>
<p>The serial format supports the full generality of Java serialization
including type evolution.  But serialized data can only be accessed by Java
applications, its size is larger, and its bindings are slower to execute.</p>
<h3>Record Number Format</h3>
<p>Any use of an access method with record number keys, and therefore
any use of a stored List view, requires using
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/RecordNumberFormat.html">RecordNumberFormat</a>
 for the key
format.  Since Berkeley DB stores record number keys using a platform-dependent
byte order, 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/RecordNumberFormat.html">RecordNumberFormat</a>
 is needed
to store record numbers properly.
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/RecordNumberBinding.html">RecordNumberBinding</a>
 should also normally
be used, although it is possible to implement your own binding for
record numbers.  See <a href="../../ref/am_conf/logrec.html">logical record
numbers</a> for more information on Berkeley DB record numbers.</p>
<p><b>Warning:</b> You may not use
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/RecordNumberFormat.html">RecordNumberFormat</a>
 except with record
number keys, as determined by the access method.  Using
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/RecordNumberFormat.html">RecordNumberFormat</a>
 in other cases will
create a database that is not portable between platforms.  Java API will
throw an 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.html">IllegalArgumentException</a>
 in such cases,
when constructing the 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/DataStore.html">DataStore</a>
 or
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/DataIndex.html">DataIndex</a>
.</p>
<h3>Custom Data Formats</h3>
<p>To create a custom format, simply provide a class that implements
the 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/DataFormat.html">DataFormat</a>
 interface, and then
create bindings that use this format.  The Java API imposes no restrictions
on data formats.  It is up to the application to ensure that formats are
platform-independent when portability is a requirement.</p>
<h3>Using Data Formats</h3>
<p>Data formats are objects which implement the
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/DataFormat.html">DataFormat</a>
 interface, which is a tag
interface with no methods.  Format objects are used primarily to identify
a format, not to operate on the data.  Bindings, which are described
later, operate on the data.</p>
<p>To create a format, construct a format class such as
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/serial/SerialFormat.html">SerialFormat</a>
 or
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/tuple/TupleFormat.html">TupleFormat</a>
.  Format objects are
specified when creating bindings, stores and indices.</p>
<p>An application should create a format for each unique data
representation.  The Java API can then perform checks to ensure that stores,
indices, bindings and key extractors all use formats consistently.  This
can help uncover bugs before data is written to the database.</p>
<p>Formats are determined to be equal by calling their equals() method,
not by comparing their classes.  This allows an application to create two
tuple formats of the same class, for example, for a Part number and a
Supplier number.  Even though the physical format of the keys in this case
may be the same, they are considered to be two distinct formats.</p>
<p>For example, an application may create two data stores, Parts and
Suppliers, specifying two different tuple formats for their keys, and two
different serial formats for their values.  When bindings are created for
these, specific formats are associated with each binding.  When creating a
data store or data index, specific formats are also specified.  The Java API
compares data formats that should be equal and throws
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/lang/IllegalArgumentException.html">IllegalArgumentException</a>
 when they are not equal.
For example, the key format of a data store must be equal to the key format
of a binding used with that date store.</p>
<h3>Selecting Data Bindings</h3>
<p>There are two types of binding interfaces.  Simple data bindings
implement the 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a>
 interface
and can be used for key or value objects.  Entity bindings implement the
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/EntityBinding.html">EntityBinding</a>
 interface and are used for
combined key and value objects called entities.</p>
<p>Simple data bindings map between the key or value data stored by
Berkeley DB and a key or value object.  This is a simple one-to-one mapping
and a single data format is used for each binding.</p>
<p>Simple data bindings are easy to implement and in some cases require
no coding.  For example, a
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/serial/SerialBinding.html">SerialBinding</a>
 can be used for
keys or values without writing any additional code.</p>
<p>Entity bindings must divide an entity object into its key and
value data, and then combine the key and value data to re-create the
entity object.  This is a two-to-one mapping and two data formats are
used for each binding.</p>
<p>Entity bindings are useful when a stored application object naturally
has its primary key as a property, which is very common.  For example, an
Employee object would naturally have an EmployeeNumber property (its
primary key) and an entity binding would then be needed.  Of course, entity
bindings are more complex to implement, especially because their key and
data formats may be different.</p>
<p>Note that even when an entity binding is used a key binding is also
usually needed.  The key binding is used, for example, to define key objects
that are passed to the 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/util/Map.get().html">Map.get()</a>
 method.  A key
object is passed to this method even though it may return an entity that
also contains the key.</p>
<h3>Implementing Data Bindings</h3>
<p>There are two ways to implement bindings.  The first way is to create
a binding class that implements one of the two binding interfaces,
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/DataBinding.html">DataBinding</a>
 or
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/EntityBinding.html">EntityBinding</a>
.  For each built-in data
format there are a number of abstract classes that make
this easier.  For example, you can extend
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/tuple/TupleBinding.html">TupleBinding</a>
 to implement a simple
binding for a tuple key or value.  Abstract classes are also provided for
entity bindings and are named after the format names of the key and value.
For example, you can extend
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/serial/TupleSerialBinding.html">TupleSerialBinding</a>
 to
implement an entity binding with a tuple key and serial value.</p>
<p>Another way to implement bindings is with marshalling interfaces.
These are interfaces which perform the binding operations and are implemented
by the key, value or entity classes themselves.  With marshalling you use
a binding which calls the marshalling interface and you implement the
marshalling interface for each key, value or entity class.  For example, you
can use 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/tuple/TupleMarshalledBinding.html">TupleMarshalledBinding</a>
along with key or value classes that implement the
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/tuple/MarshalledTupleData.html">MarshalledTupleData</a>
 interface.</p>
<h3>Using Data Bindings</h3>
<p>Bindings are specified whenever a stored collection is created.  A
key binding must be specified for map, key set and entry set views.  A value
binding or entity binding must be specified for map, list, value set and
entry set views.</p>
<p>Any number of bindings may be created for the same stored data.  This
allows multiple views over the same data.  For example, a tuple might be
bound to an array of values or to a class with properties for each object.</p>
<p>It is important to be careful of bindings that only use a subset of the
stored data.  This can be useful to simplify a view or to hide information
that should not be accessible.  However, if you write information using these
bindings you may create stored data that is invalid from the application's
point of view.  It is up to the application to guard against this by creating
a read-only collection when such bindings are used.</p>
<h3>Key Extractors</h3>
<p>Key extractors are needed whenever database indices are used.  For
each database index (
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/DataIndex.html">DataIndex</a>
) or
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/ForeignKeyIndex.html">ForeignKeyIndex</a>
 a key extractor is
used to derive index key data from key/value data.  Key extractors are
objects whose classes implement the 
<a href="../../java/com/sleepycat/bdb/bind/KeyExtractor.html">KeyExtractor</a>
 interface.</p>
<p>Like bindings, key extractors may be implemented using a separate key
extractor class or using a marshalling interface.  Abstract key extractor
classes and marshalling interfaces are provided in the
com.sleepycat.bdb.bind.tuple and com.sleepycat.bdb.bind.serial packages.</p>
<p>Unlike bindings, key extractors fundamentally operate on key and
value data, not necessarily on the objects derived from data by bindings.
In this sense key extractors are a part of a database definition, and may
be independent of the various bindings that may be used to view data in a
database.  However, key extractors are not prohibited from using higher
level objects produced by bindings, and doing so may be convenient for some
applications.  For example, marshalling interfaces, which are defined for
objects produced by bindings, are a convenient way to define key
extractors.</p>
