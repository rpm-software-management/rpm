<h3 align=center>Entity - Combining the key and value in a single object</h3>
<p>In the prior examples, the keys and values of each store were
represented using separate classes.  For example, a <b>PartKey</b>
and a <b>PartValue</b> class were used.  Many times it is desirable
to have a single class representing both the key and the value, for
example, a <b>Part</b> class.</p>
<p>Such a combined key and value class is called an <i>entity class</i>
and is used along with an <i>entity binding</i>.  Entity bindings combine a
key and a value into an entity when reading a record from a collection, and
split an entity into a key and a value when writing a record to a
collection.  Entity bindings are used in place of value bindings, and entity
objects are used with collections in place of value objects.</p>
<p>The example program illustrates:</p>
<p><ul type=disc>
<li><a href="classes.html">Defining entity classes</a>
<li><a href="bindings.html">Creating entity bindings</a>
<li><a href="views.html">Creating collections with entity bindings</a>
<li><a href="read.html">Using entities with collections</a>
</ul>
<p>Some reasons for using entities are:</p>
<p><ul type=disc>
<li>When the key is a property of an entity object representing the
record as a whole, the object's identity and concept are often clearer than
with key and value objects that are disjoint.
<li>A single entity object per record is often more convenient to use
than two objects.
</ul>
<p>Of course, instead of using an entity binding, you could simply create
the entity yourself after reading the key and value from a collection, and
split the entity into a key and value yourself before writing it to a
collection.  But this would detract from the convenience of the using the
Java collections API.  It is convenient to obtain a <b>Part</b> object
directly from 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/util/Map.html#get">Map.get</a>
 and to add a <b>Part</b>
object using 
<a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.3/docs/api/java/util/Set.html#add">Set.add</a>
.  Collections having entity
bindings can be used naturally without combining and splitting objects each
time a collection method is called; however, an entity binding class must be
defined by the application.</p>
<p>In addition to showing how to use entity bindings, this example
illustrates a key feature of all bindings:  Bindings are independent of
database storage parameters and formats.  Compare this example to the prior
Index example and you'll see that the <b>Sample</b> and
<b>SampleViews</b> classes have been changed to use entity bindings, but the
<b>SampleDatabase</b> class was not changed at all.  In fact, the Entity
program and the Index program can be used interchangeably to access the same
physical database files.  This demonstrates that bindings are only a "view"
onto the physical stored data.  Note that formats are managed by the
<b>SampleDatabase</b> class because they define the physical syntax of the
stored data.</p>
<p>The complete source
of the final version of the example program is included in the Berkeley DB
distribution.</p>
