<h3 align=center>Building for VxWorks AE</h3>
<p>The build_vxworks directory in the Berkeley DB distribution contains component
files for Tornado 3.1.  The Berkeley DB distribution also contains workspace
and project files for Tornado 2.X.  See
<a href="../../ref/build_vxworks/intro.html">Building for VxWorks</a> for
information about Tornado 2.0/VxWorks 5.4 and Tornado 2.2/VxWorks 5.5.</p>
The VxWorks AE component files are all within subdirectories, and
all component files are named <i>component.wpj</i>.

<h3>Building With Tornado 3.1</h3>
<p>This document assumes you already have a workspace set up and you
want to add Berkeley DB as a component in that workspace.  You may include
this component in any domain deemed appropriate for your application.</p>
<p>To add the Berkeley DB component into your workspace, right-click on the
"Components" and choose <i>Add existing...</i>.  Enter
the pathname to your Berkeley DB distribution in the form
<i>&lt;pathname to your Berkeley DB distribution&gt;</i>
<b>/build_vxworks/Berkeley DB/</b>.
You will see <b>component.wpj</b> listed under the "Files".
Choose that filename and click "Ok".  You will now have
a Berkeley DB component in your workspace.</p>
<p>There are essentially three options regarding protection
domains and the Berkeley DB component.  The first option is to add
the Berkeley DB component directly into your application domain.  You may
choose to do this by downloading Berkeley DB into that domain on your
target, or by adding the component to the domain itself and it will
be built when the application domain is built.  The disadvantage
of this option is that no other application domain will have access to
the Berkeley DB interfaces. </p>
<p>The second option is to add the Berkeley DB component directly into your
<i>vxKernel</i> domain.  The advantage is that any application
using the Berkeley DB interface would have access to them and no changes
would be necessary to the linkage path.  The disadvantage is that
all Berkeley DB code would run with system privileges. </p>
<p>The third option is to add a Berkeley DB shared library domain to your
system.  Then add or download the Berkeley DB component to that shared
library domain.  The advantage is that all application domains
using the Berkeley DB interfaces can access a single copy of the library
running in user mode.  The disadvantages are that one must
remember to add the Berkeley DB shared library domain to the linkage
path of every application domain using Berkeley DB and that shared library
domains may not link against one another, a consideration if the
application using Berkeley DB is itself a shared library.</p>
<p>We believe the options outlined above are the most common methods
that the Berkeley DB component will be used.  We believe that the third
option, creating a shared library domain, is the most useful option.
Ultimately, the responsibility of choosing the correct mechanism
for including the Berkeley DB component into the appropriate domain falls
to the application developer.</p>
<p>The remainder of this document assumes that you already have a
VxWorks AE target and a target server, both up and running.  It also
assumes that your VxWorks AE image is configured properly for your
needs.  It also assumes that you
have an acceptable file system already available.  See
<a href="../../ref/build_vxworks/faq.html">VxWorks FAQ</a> for more
information about file system requirements.</p>
<p>To build Berkeley DB, first, you need to set the build selection.  To do
this, right-click on the Berkeley DB component name and choose the
<i>Build settings...</i> selection.  If you look at the
<i>Active Build Specification</i> drop down list, you will see
several different builds, containing different configurations. </p>
<table border=1 align=center>
<tr><th>Build</th><th>Description</th></tr>
<tr>    <td align=left>PENTIUM2gnu.debug</td>    <td align=left>PII BSP with debugging</td>    </tr>
<tr>    <td align=left>PENTIUM2gnu.release</td>    <td align=left>PII BSP no debugging</td>    </tr>
</table>
<p>You have to add a new build specification if you use a
different BSP, want to add a build for the simulator or
want to customize further.  For instance, if you have the Power PC (PPC)
BSP, you need to add a new build for the PPC tool chain.  To do so,
select the "Add..." button in the <i>Build Settings</i> window.
A new window will appear giving you a list of all the BSPs
you have available from which to choose.
For your new build target, you need to decide whether it should be built for
debugging.  See the <i>C/C++ compiler</i> tab of the Pentium
builds for ways to
configure for each case.  After you add this build, you still need
to configure the include directories correctly, as described in the
sections that follow.</p>
<p>If you are running with a different
BSP, you should remove the build specifications that do not apply to
your hardware.  We recommend that you do this after you configure any
new build specifications first. </p>
<p>If you are adding a new build you must set the include directories
correctly.  After you have added the new build in the "Build Settings"
window, click on the <i>C/C++ compiler</i> tab.
In the edit box, you need to add the pathname of the
<i>build_vxworks</i> subdirectory of Berkeley DB, followed by the
pathname of Berkeley DB.  You should add these directories
relative to the project directory, using the <b>PRJ_DIR</b>
macro, which is the Berkeley DB subdirectory of <i>build_vxworks</i>.
Then, click OK.  The typical addition of include
directories will look like:</p>
<blockquote><pre>-I$(PRJ_DIR)/.. -I$(PRJ_DIR)/../..</pre></blockquote>
<p>To build and download the Berkeley DB downloadable application for the first time
requires several steps: </p>
<ol>
<p><li>Select the build you are interested in using the <i>Build Settings</i>
window.  Click OK when done.
<p><li>Select the Berkeley DB component and right-click.  Choose the
<i>Clean Build</i> selection.
<p><li>Select the Berkeley DB component and right-click.  Choose the
<i>Download...</i> selection.
</ol>
<p>You need to repeat this procedure for all builds you are interested in
building, as well as for all of the utility project builds you want to
run.</p>
