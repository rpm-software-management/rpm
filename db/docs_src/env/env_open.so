or more of the features of m4_db.])

m4_parambegin
m4_param_utf8(db_home, [dnl
The m4_arg(db_home) parameter is the database environment's home
directory.  For more information on m4_arg(db_home), and filename
resolution in general, see m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/env/naming, [m4_db File
Naming]).  The environment variable m4_envvar(DB_HOME) may be used as
the path of the database home, as described in
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/env/naming, [m4_db File Naming]).])

m4_param(flags, [dnl
The m4_arg(flags) parameter specifies the subsystems that are initialized
and how the application's environment affects m4_db file naming, among
other things.

m4_sf_or_may

m4_p([dnl
Because there are a large number of flags that can be specified, they
have been grouped together by functionality.  The first group of flags
indicates which of the m4_db subsystems should be initialized.])

m4_p([dnl
The choice of subsystems initialized for a m4_db database environment
is specified by the thread of control initially creating the
environment.  Any subsequent thread of control joining the environment
will automatically be configured to use the same subsystems as were
created in the environment (unless the thread of control requests a
subsystem not available in the environment, which will fail).
Applications joining an environment, able to adapt to whatever
subsystems have been configured in the environment, should open the
environment without specifying any subsystem flags.  Applications
joining an environment, requiring specific subsystems from their
environments, should open the environment specifying those specific
subsystem flags.])

m4_tagbegin

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_INIT_CDB), [dnl
Initialize locking for the m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/cam/intro, m4_cam)
product.  In this mode, m4_db provides multiple reader/single writer
access.  The only other subsystem that should be specified with the
m4_ref(DB_INIT_CDB) flag is m4_ref(DB_INIT_MPOOL).])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_INIT_LOCK), [dnl
Initialize the locking subsystem.  This subsystem should be used when
multiple processes or threads are going to be reading and writing a
m4_db database, so that they do not interfere with each other.  If all
threads are accessing the database(s) read-only, locking is unnecessary.
When the m4_ref(DB_INIT_LOCK) flag is specified, it is usually necessary
to run a deadlock detector, as well.  See m4_ref(db_deadlock) and
m4_ref(lock_detect) for more information.])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_INIT_LOG), [dnl
Initialize the logging subsystem.  This subsystem should be used when
recovery from application or system failure is necessary.  If the log
region is being created and log files are already present, the log files
are reviewed; subsequent log writes are appended to the end of the log,
rather than overwriting current log entries.])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_INIT_MPOOL), [dnl
Initialize the shared memory buffer pool subsystem.  This subsystem
should be used whenever an application is using any m4_db access
method.])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_INIT_REP), [dnl
Initialize the replication subsystem.  This subsystem
should be used whenever an application plans on using replication.
The m4_ref(DB_INIT_REP) flag requires the m4_ref(DB_INIT_TXN) and
m4_ref(DB_INIT_LOCK) flags also be configured.])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_INIT_TXN), [dnl
Initialize the transaction subsystem.  This subsystem should be used
when recovery and atomicity of multiple operations are important.  The
m4_ref(DB_INIT_TXN) flag implies the m4_ref(DB_INIT_LOG) flag.])

m4_tagend

m4_p([dnl
The second group of flags govern what recovery, if any, is performed when
the environment is initialized:])

m4_tagbegin
m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_RECOVER), [dnl
Run normal recovery on this environment before opening it for normal
use.  If this flag is set, the m4_ref(DB_CREATE) and m4_ref(DB_INIT_TXN)
flags must also be set, because the regions will be removed and
re-created, and transactions are required for application recovery.])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_RECOVER_FATAL), [dnl
Run catastrophic recovery on this environment before opening it for
normal use.  If this flag is set, the m4_ref(DB_CREATE) and
m4_ref(DB_INIT_TXN) flags must also be set, because the regions will be
removed and re-created, and transactions are required for application
recovery.])


m4_tagend

m4_p([dnl
A standard part of the recovery process is to remove the existing m4_db
environment and create a new one in which to perform recovery.  If the
thread of control performing recovery does not specify the correct
region initialization information (for example, the correct memory pool
cache size), the result can be an application running in an environment
with incorrect cache and other subsystem sizes.  For this reason, the
thread of control performing recovery should specify correct
configuration information before calling the m4_refT(dbenv_open); or it
should remove the environment after recovery is completed, leaving
creation of the correctly sized environment to a subsequent call to
m4_ref(dbenv_open).])

m4_p([dnl
All m4_db recovery processing must be single-threaded; that is, only a
single thread of control may perform recovery or access a m4_db
environment while recovery is being performed.  Because it is not an
error to specify m4_ref(DB_RECOVER) for an environment for which no
recovery is required, it is reasonable programming practice for the
thread of control responsible for performing recovery and creating the
environment to always specify the m4_ref(DB_CREATE) and
m4_ref(DB_RECOVER) flags during startup.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(dbenv_open) function returns successfully if m4_ref(DB_RECOVER)
or m4_ref(DB_RECOVER_FATAL) is specified and no log files exist, so it
is necessary to ensure that all necessary log files are present before
running recovery.  For further information, consult m4_ref(db_archive)
and m4_ref(db_recover).])

m4_p([dnl
The third group of flags govern file-naming extensions in the environment:])

m4_tagend

m4_p([Finally, there are a few additional unrelated flags:])

m4_tagbegin
m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_CREATE), [dnl
Cause m4_db subsystems to create any underlying files, as necessary.])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_LOCKDOWN), [dnl
Lock shared m4_db environment files and memory-mapped databases into
memory.])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_PRIVATE), [dnl
Allocate region memory from the heap instead of from memory backed by
the filesystem or system shared memory.
m4_p([dnl
This flag implies the environment will only be accessed by a single
process (although that process may be multithreaded).  This flag has two
effects on the m4_db environment.  First, all underlying data structures
are allocated from per-process memory instead of from shared memory that
is accessible to more than a single process.  Second, mutexes are only
configured to work between threads.])
m4_p([dnl
This flag should not be specified if more than a single process is
accessing the environment because it is likely to cause database
corruption and unpredictable behavior.  For example, if both a server
application and m4_db utilities (for example, m4_ref(db_archive),
m4_ref(db_checkpoint) or m4_ref(db_stat)) are expected to access the
environment, the m4_ref(DB_PRIVATE) flag should not be specified.])
m4_p([dnl
See m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/env/region, [Shared Memory Regions]) for more
information.])])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_REGISTER), [dnl
Check to see if recovery needs to be performed before opening the
database environment.  (For this check to be accurate, all processes
using the environment must specify m4_ref(DB_REGISTER) when opening the
environment.)  If recovery needs to be performed for any reason
(including the initial use of the m4_ref(DB_REGISTER) flag), and
m4_ref(DB_RECOVER) is also specified, recovery will be performed and the
open will proceed normally.  If recovery needs to be performed and
m4_ref(DB_RECOVER) is not specified, m4_ref(DB_RUNRECOVERY) will be
returned.  If recovery does not need to be performed, the
m4_ref(DB_RECOVER) flag will be ignored.  See
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/transapp/app, Architecting Transactional Data Store
applications) for more information.])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_SYSTEM_MEM), [dnl
Allocate region memory from system shared memory instead of from heap
memory or memory backed by the filesystem.
m4_p([dnl
See m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/env/region, [Shared Memory Regions]) for more
information.])])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_THREAD), [dnl
Cause the m4_ref(DbEnv) handle returned by m4_ref(dbenv_open) to be
m4_italic(free-threaded); that is, concurrently usable by multiple
threads in the address space.  The DB_THREAD flag should be specified
if the m4_ref(DbEnv) handle will be concurrently used by more than one
thread in the process, or if any m4_ref(Db) handles opened in the scope
of the m4_ref(DbEnv) handle will be concurrently used by more than one
thread in the process.])
