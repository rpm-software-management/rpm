In some applications, the expense of page-faulting the underlying shared
memory regions can affect performance.  (For example, if the page-fault
occurs while holding a lock, other lock requests can convoy, and overall
throughput may decrease.)  If set, m4_db will page-fault shared regions
into memory when initially creating or joining a m4_db environment.  In
addition, m4_db will write the shared regions when creating an
environment, forcing the underlying virtual memory and filesystems to
instantiate both the necessary memory and the necessary disk space.
