The m4_refT(dbenv_failchk) checks for threads of control (either a true
thread or a process) that have exited while manipulating m4_db library
data structures, while holding a logical database lock, or with an
unresolved transaction (that is, a transaction that was never aborted
or committed).  For more information, see m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/cam/app,
Architecting Data Store and Concurrent Data Store applications), and
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/transapp/app, Architecting Transactional Data Store
applications).])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_refT(dbenv_failchk) is based on the "thread_id" and "is_alive"
functions specified to the m4_refT(dbenv_set_thread_id).  Applications
calling the m4_refT(dbenv_failchk) must have already called the
m4_refT(dbenv_set_isalive), on the same m4_ref(DbEnv), and must have
configured their database environment using the
m4_refT(dbenv_set_thread_count).])

m4_p([dnl
If m4_ref(dbenv_failchk) determines a thread of control exited while
holding database read locks, it will release those locks.  If
m4_ref(dbenv_failchk) determines a thread of control exited with an
unresolved transaction, the transaction will be aborted.  In either of
these cases, m4_ref(dbenv_failchk) will return 0 and the application may
continue to use the database environment.])

m4_p([dnl
In either of these cases, the m4_refT(dbenv_failchk) will also report
the process and thread IDs associated with any released locks or
aborted transactions.  The information is printed to a specified output
channel (see the m4_refT(dbenv_set_msgfile) for more information), or
passed to an application callback function (see the
m4_refT(dbenv_set_msgcall) for more information).])

m4_p([dnl
If m4_ref(dbenv_failchk) determines a thread of control has exited such
that database environment recovery is required, it will return
m4_ref(DB_RUNRECOVERY).  In this case, the application should not
continue to use the database environment.  For a further description as
to the actions the application should take when this failure occurs, see
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/cam/fail, Handling failure in Data Store and
Concurrent Data Store applications), and
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/transapp/fail, Handling failure in Transactional
Data Store applications).])
