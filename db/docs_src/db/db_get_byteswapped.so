The m4_refT(dbh_get_byteswapped) returns if the underlying database
files were created on an architecture of the same byte order as the
current one, or if they were not (that is, big-endian on a little-endian
machine, or vice versa). This information may be used to determine
whether application data needs to be adjusted for this architecture or
not.])
