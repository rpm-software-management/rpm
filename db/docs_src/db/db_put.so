m4_p([dnl
The m4_refT(dbh_put) stores key/data pairs in the database.  The default
behavior of the m4_ref(dbh_put) function is to enter the new key/data
pair, replacing any previously existing key if duplicates are disallowed,
or adding a duplicate data item if duplicates are allowed.  If the database
supports duplicates, the m4_refT(dbh_put) adds the new data value at the
end of the duplicate set.  If the database supports sorted duplicates,
the new data value is inserted at the correct sorted location.])

Append the key/data pair to the end of the database.  For the
DB_APPEND flag to be specified, the underlying database must be
a Queue or Recno database.  The record number allocated to the record is
returned in the specified m4_arg(key).
m4_p([dnl
There is a minor behavioral difference between the Recno and Queue access
methods for the m4_ref(DB_APPEND) flag.  If a transaction enclosing a
m4_ref(dbh_put) operation with the m4_ref(DB_APPEND) flag aborts, the
record number may be decremented (and later reallocated by a subsequent
m4_ref(DB_APPEND) operation) by the Recno access method, but will not be
decremented or reallocated by the Queue access method.])])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_NODUPDATA), [dnl
In the case of the Btree and Hash access methods, enter the new key/data
pair only if it does not already appear in the database.
m4_p([dnl
The DB_NODUPDATA flag may only be specified if the underlying
database has been configured to support sorted duplicates.  The
DB_NODUPDATA flag may not be specified to the Queue or Recno
access methods.])

Enter the new key/data pair only if the key does not already appear in the

set will fail if the key already exists in the database, even if the database
supports duplicates.
