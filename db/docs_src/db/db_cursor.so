Configure a transactional cursor to operate with read-only

with the m4_ref(DB_MULTIVERSION) flag set, data values will be read as
they are when the cursor is opened, without taking read locks.  This
flag implicitly begins a transaction that is committed when the cursor
is closed.  Silently ignored if m4_ref(DB_MULTIVERSION) not set on the
underlying database or if a transaction is supplied in the m4_arg(txnid)
parameter.])

m4_param(txnid, [dnl
Cursor operations are not automatically transaction-protected, even if
the m4_ref(DB_AUTO_COMMIT) flag is specified to the
m4_ref(dbenv_set_flags) or m4_refT(dbh_open)s.  If cursor operations are
to be transaction-protected, the m4_arg(txnid) parameter must be a
transaction handle returned from m4_ref(txn_begin); otherwise, NULL.  To
transaction-protect cursor operations, cursors must be opened and closed
within the context of a transaction, and the m4_arg(txnid) parameter
specifies the transaction context in which the cursor may be used.])
