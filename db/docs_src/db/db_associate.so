m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(dbh_associate) function is used to declare one database a
secondary index for a primary database.  After a secondary database has
been "associated" with a primary database, all updates to the primary
will be automatically reflected in the secondary and all reads from the
secondary will return corresponding data from the primary.  Note that
as primary keys must be unique for secondary indices to work, the
primary database must be configured without support for duplicate data
items.  See m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/am/second, [Secondary indices]) for
more information.])

m4_arg(result) m4_ref(Dbt), which indicates that m4_db should free the

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_DBT_MULTIPLE), [dnl
To return multiple secondary keys, m4_ref(DB_DBT_MULTIPLE) should be set
in the m4_arg(flags) field of the m4_arg(result) m4_ref(Dbt), which
indicates m4_db should treat the m4_arg(size) field as the number of
secondary keys (zero or more), and the m4_arg(data) field as a pointer
to an array of that number of m4_ref(Dbt)s describing the set of
secondary keys.

m4_bold([When multiple secondary keys are returned, keys may not be repeated]).
In other words, there must be no repeated record numbers in the array
for Recno and Queue databases, and keys must not compare equally using
the secondary database's comparison function for Btree and Hash
databases.  If keys are repeated, operations may fail and the secondary
may become inconsistent with the primary.])
m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(DB_DBT_APPMALLOC) flag may be set for any m4_ref(Dbt) in the

field to indicate that m4_db should free the array once it is done with
all of the returned keys.])])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_DONOTINDEX), [dnl
If any key/data pair in the primary yields a null secondary key and
should be left out of the secondary index, the callback function may
optionally return m4_ref(DB_DONOTINDEX).  Otherwise, the callback
function should return 0 in case of success or an error outside of the
m4_db name space in case of failure; the error code will be returned
from the m4_db call that initiated the callback.
m4_p([dnl
If the callback function returns m4_ref(DB_DONOTINDEX) for any key/data
pairs in the primary database, the secondary index will not contain any
reference to those key/data pairs, and such operations as cursor
iterations and range queries will reflect only the corresponding subset
of the database.  If this is not desirable, the application should
ensure that the callback function is well-defined for all possible
values and never returns m4_ref(DB_DONOTINDEX).])
m4_p([dnl
Returning m4_ref(DB_DONOTINDEX) is equivalent to setting
m4_ref(DB_DBT_MULTIPLE) on the m4_arg(result) m4_ref(Dbt) and setting
the m4_arg(size) field to zero.])])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_IMMUTABLE_KEY), [dnl
Specifies the secondary key is immutable.
m4_p([dnl
This flag can be used to optimize updates when the secondary key in a
primary record will never be changed after the primary record is
inserted.  For immutable secondary keys, a best effort is made to avoid
calling the secondary callback function when primary records are
updated.  This optimization may reduce the overhead of update operations
significantly if the callback function is expensive.])
m4_p([dnl
Be sure to specify this flag only if the secondary key in the primary
record is never changed.  If this rule is violated, the secondary index
will become corrupted, that is, it will become out of sync with the
primary.])])

The m4_arg(secondary) parameter should be an open database handle of

safe to associate as a secondary database a handle that is in use by
another thread of control or has open cursors.  If the handle was opened
with the m4_ref(DB_THREAD) flag it is safe to use it in multiple threads
of control after the m4_refT(dbh_associate) has returned.  Note also
that either secondary keys must be unique or the secondary database must
be configured with support for duplicate data items.])
