m4_p([dnl
The m4_refT(dbh_open) opens the database represented by the m4_arg(file)
and m4_arg(database) parameters for both reading and writing.])

m4_p([dnl
The currently supported m4_db file formats (or m4_italic(access
methods)) are Btree, Hash, Queue, and Recno.  The Btree format is a
representation of a sorted, balanced tree structure.  The Hash format
is an extensible, dynamic hashing scheme.  The Queue format supports
fast access to fixed-length records accessed sequentially or by logical
record number.  The Recno format supports fixed- or variable-length
records, accessed sequentially or by logical record number, and
optionally backed by a flat text file.])

m4_p([dnl
Storage and retrieval for the m4_db access methods are based on key/data
pairs; see m4_ref(Dbt) for more information.])

m4_p([dnl
Calling m4_ref(dbh_open) is a relatively expensive operation, and
maintaining a set of open databases will normally be preferable to
repeatedly opening and closing the database for each new query.])

m4_return(dbh_open, std, [dnl
If m4_ref(dbh_open) fails, the m4_refT(dbh_close) must be called to
discard the m4_ref(Db) handle.])

m4_parambegin
m4_param(database, [dnl
The m4_arg(database) parameter is optional, and allows applications to
have multiple databases in a single file.  Although no m4_arg(database)
parameter needs to be specified, it is an error to attempt to open a
second database in a m4_arg(file) that was not initially created using
a m4_arg(database) name.  Further, the m4_arg(database) parameter is not
supported by the Queue format.  Finally, when opening multiple databases
in the same physical file, it is important to consider locking and
memory cache issues; see m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/am/opensub, Opening
multiple databases in a single file) for more information.
m4_p([dnl
In-memory databases never intended to be preserved on disk may be
created by setting the m4_arg(file) parameter to NULL.  If the
m4_arg(database) parameter is also NULL, the database is strictly
temporary and cannot be opened by any other thread of control, thus the
database can only be accessed by sharing the single database handle that
created it, in circumstances where doing so is safe.  If the
m4_arg(database) parameter is not set to NULL, the database can be opened
by other threads of control and will be replicated to client sites in
any replication group.])])

m4_param_utf8(file, [dnl
The m4_arg(file) parameter is used as the name of an underlying file that
will be used to back the database; see m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/env/naming,
File naming) for more information.

Enclose the m4_ref(dbh_open) call within a transaction.  If the call
succeeds, the open operation will be recoverable and all subsequent
database modification operations based on this handle will be
transactionally protected.  If the call fails, no database will have
been created.])

Create the database.  If the database does not already exist and the
DB_CREATE flag is not specified, the m4_ref(dbh_open) will fail.])

Return an error if the database already exists.  The m4_ref(DB_EXCL)
flag is only meaningful when specified with the m4_ref(DB_CREATE)
flag.])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_MULTIVERSION), [dnl
Open the database with support for m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/transapp/read,
multiversion concurrency control).  This will cause updates to the
database to follow a copy-on-write protocol, which is required to
support snapshot isolation.  The m4_ref(DB_MULTIVERSION) flag requires
that the database be transactionally protected during its open and is
not supported by the queue format.])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_NOMMAP), [dnl
Do not map this database into process memory (see the
m4_refT(dbenv_set_mp_mmapsize) for further information).])

Open the database for reading only.  Any attempt to modify items in the
database will fail, regardless of the actual permissions of any
underlying files.])

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED), [dnl
Support transactional read operations with degree 1 isolation.  Read
operations on the database may request the return of modified but not
yet committed data.  This flag must be specified on all m4_ref(Db)
handles used to perform dirty reads or database updates, otherwise
requests for dirty reads may not be honored and the read may block.])

Physically truncate the underlying file, discarding all previous

to implement this flag.  For this reason, it is applicable only to the
file and cannot be used to discard databases within a file.

Note that transactionally protected operations on a m4_ref(Db) handle

the handle is closed; see m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/program/scope, m4_db

m4_idef(DB_RECNO), or m4_idef(DB_UNKNOWN).  If m4_arg(type) is
DB_UNKNOWN, the database must already exist and m4_ref(dbh_open) will
