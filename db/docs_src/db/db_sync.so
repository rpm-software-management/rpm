It is important to understand that flushing cached information to disk
only minimizes the window of opportunity for corrupted data.]) Although
unlikely, it is possible for database corruption to happen if a system
or application crash occurs while writing data to the database.  To
ensure that database corruption never occurs, applications must either:
use transactions and logging with automatic recovery; use logging and
application-specific recovery; or edit a copy of the database, and once
all applications using the database have successfully called
m4_ref(dbh_close), atomically replace the original database with the
updated copy.])
