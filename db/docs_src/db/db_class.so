m4_ref(Db) handles are free-threaded if the m4_ref(DB_THREAD) flag is
specified to the m4_refT(dbh_open) when the database is opened or if the
database environment in which the database is opened is free-threaded.
The handle should not be closed while any other handle that refers to
the database is in use; for example, database handles must not be closed
while cursor handles into the database remain open, or transactions that
include operations on the database have not yet been committed or
aborted.  Once the m4_ref(dbh_close), m4_ref(dbh_remove),
m4_ref(dbh_rename), or m4_refT(dbh_verify)s are called, the handle may
not be accessed again, regardless of the method's return.])

The m4_ref(dbh_create) function creates a m4_ref(Db) structure that is
the handle for a m4_db database.  This function allocates memory for the
structure, returning a pointer to the structure in the memory to which
m4_arg(dbp) refers.  To release the allocated memory and discard the
handle, call the m4_ref(dbh_close), m4_ref(dbh_remove),
m4_ref(dbh_rename), or m4_refT(dbh_verify)s.])

The m4_ref(Db) handle contains a special field, "app_private", which is

by m4_db in any way.])

The m4_db C++ API supports two different error behaviors.  By default,
whenever an error occurs, an exception is thrown that encapsulates the
error information.  This generally allows for cleaner logic for
transaction processing because a try block can surround a single
transaction.  However, if m4_ref(DB_CXX_NO_EXCEPTIONS) is specified,
exceptions are not thrown; instead, each individual function returns an
error code.
