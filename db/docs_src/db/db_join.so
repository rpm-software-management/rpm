The m4_refT(dbh_join) creates a specialized join cursor for use in
performing equality or natural joins on secondary indices.  For
information on how to organize your data to use this functionality, see
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/am/join, [Equality join]).])

The m4_refT(dbh_join) method is called using the m4_ref(Db) handle of
the primary database.])

cursor functions:])

m4_tagbegin
m4_tag(m4_ref(dbc_get), [dnl
Iterates over the values associated with the keys to which each item in
m4_arg(curslist) was initialized.  Any data value that appears in all
items specified by the m4_arg(curslist) parameter is then used as a key
into the m4_arg(primary), and the key/data pair found in the
m4_arg(primary) is returned.

m4_parambegin
m4_param(curslist, [dnl
The m4_arg(curslist) parameter contains a NULL terminated array of cursors.
Each cursor must have been initialized to refer to the key on which the
underlying database should be joined.  Typically, this initialization is done
by a m4_ref(dbc_get) call with the m4_ref(DB_SET) flag specified.  Once the
cursors have been passed as part of a m4_arg(curslist), they should not
be accessed or modified until the newly created join cursor has been closed,
or else inconsistent results may be returned.
m4_p([dnl
Joined values are retrieved by doing a sequential iteration over the first
cursor in the m4_arg(curslist) parameter, and a nested iteration over each
secondary cursor in the order they are specified in the m4_arg(curslist)
parameter.  This requires database traversals to search for the current
datum in all the cursors after the first.  For this reason, the best join
performance normally results from sorting the cursors from the one that
refers to the least number of data items to the one that refers to the
most.  By default, m4_ref(dbh_join) does this sort on behalf of its caller.])
m4_p([dnl
For the returned join cursor to be used in a transaction-protected manner,
the cursors listed in m4_arg(curslist) must have been created within the
context of the same transaction.])])

The newly created join cursor is returned in the memory location to
which m4_arg(dbcp) refers.])

m4_tagbegin

m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_JOIN_NOSORT), [dnl
Do not sort the cursors based on the number of data items to which they
refer.  If the data are structured so that cursors with many data items
also share many common elements, higher performance will result from
listing those cursors before cursors with fewer data items; that is, a
sort order other than the default.  The m4_ref(DB_JOIN_NOSORT) flag
permits applications to perform join optimization prior to calling
m4_ref(dbh_join).])
