m4_p([dnl
The m4_db distribution builds up to four separate libraries: the base
C API m4_db library and the optional C++, Java, and Tcl API libraries.
For portability reasons, each library is standalone and contains the
full m4_db support necessary to build applications; that is, the C++
API m4_db library does not require any other m4_db libraries to build
and run C++ applications.])

m4_p([dnl
Building for Linux, Mac OS X and the QNX Neutrino release is the same
as building for a conventional UNIX platform.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_db distribution uses the Free Software Foundation's
m4_linkweb(http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html, autoconf)
and m4_linkweb(http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html,
libtool) tools to build on UNIX platforms.  In general, the standard
configuration and installation options for these tools apply to the
m4_db distribution.])

m4_p([dnl
To do a standard UNIX build of m4_db, change to the m4_bold(build_unix)
directory and then enter the following two commands:])

m4_indent([dnl
../dist/configure
make])

m4_p([dnl
This will build the m4_db library.])

m4_p([dnl
To install the m4_db library, enter the following command:])

m4_indent([dnl
make install])

m4_p([dnl
To rebuild m4_db, enter:])

m4_indent([dnl
make clean
make])

m4_p([dnl
If you change your mind about how m4_db is to be configured, you must
start from scratch by entering the following command:])

m4_indent([dnl
make realclean
../dist/configure
make])

m4_p([dnl
To uninstall m4_db, enter:])

m4_indent([dnl
make uninstall])

m4_p([dnl
To build multiple UNIX versions of m4_db in the same source tree, create
a new directory at the same level as the build_unix directory, and then
configure and build in that directory as described previously.])
