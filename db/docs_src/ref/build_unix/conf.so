    build_unix/intro, build_unix/small)

m4_p([dnl
There are several arguments you can specify when configuring m4_db.
Although only the m4_db-specific ones are described here, most of the
standard GNU autoconf arguments are available and supported.  To see a
complete list of possible arguments, specify the --help flag to the
configure program.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_db specific arguments are as follows:])

m4_tagbegin

m4_idefz(configuring without large @file support)
m4_tag([m4_idef(--disable-largefile)], [dnl
Some systems, notably versions of HP/UX and Solaris, require special
compile-time options in order to create files larger than 2^32 bytes.
These options are automatically enabled when m4_db is compiled.  For
this reason, binaries built on current versions of these systems may
not run on earlier versions of the system because the library and system
calls necessary for large files are not available.  To disable building
with these compile-time options, enter --disable-largefile as an argument
to configure.])

m4_idefz(disabling @shared libraries, disabling @static libraries)
m4_tag([m4_idef(--disable-shared), m4_idef(--disable-static)], [dnl
On systems supporting shared libraries, m4_db builds both static and
shared libraries by default.  (Shared libraries are built using
m4_linkweb(http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/libtool.html, [the GNU
Project's Libtool]) distribution, which supports shared library builds
on many (although not all) systems.)  To not build shared libraries,
configure using the --disable-shared argument.  To not build static
libraries, configure using the --disable-static argument.])

m4_idefz(configuring m4_db @1.85 API compatibility)
m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-compat185)], [dnl
To compile or load m4_db 1.85 applications against this release of the
m4_db library, enter --enable-compat185 as an argument to configure.
This will include m4_db 1.85 API compatibility code in the library.])

m4_idefz(configuring the @C++ API)
m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-cxx)], [dnl
To build the m4_db C++ API, enter --enable-cxx as an argument to
configure.])

m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-debug)], [dnl
To build m4_db with m4_bold(-g) as a compiler flag and with
m4_bold(DEBUG) #defined during compilation, enter --enable-debug as an
argument to configure.  This will create a m4_db library and utilities
with debugging symbols, as well as load various routines that can be
called from a debugger to display pages, cursor queues, and so forth.
If installed, the utilities will not be stripped.  This argument should
not be specified when configuring to build production binaries.])

m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-debug_rop)], [dnl
To build m4_db to output log records for read operations, enter
--enable-debug_rop as an argument to configure.  This argument should not
be specified when configuring to build production binaries.])

m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-debug_wop)], [dnl
To build m4_db to output log records for write operations, enter
--enable-debug_wop as an argument to configure.  This argument should not
be specified when configuring to build production binaries.])

m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-diagnostic)], [dnl
To build m4_db with run-time debugging checks, enter --enable-diagnostic
as an argument to configure.  This causes a number of additional checks
to be performed when m4_db is running, and also causes some failures to
trigger process abort rather than returning errors to the application.
Applications built using this argument should not share database
environments with applications built without this argument.  This
argument should not be specified when configuring to build production
binaries.])

m4_idefz(building a utility to dump m4_db @1.85 databases)
m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-dump185)], [dnl
To convert m4_db 1.85 (or earlier) databases to this release of m4_db,
enter --enable-dump185 as an argument to configure.  This will build the
m4_ref(db_dump185) utility, which can dump m4_db 1.85 and 1.86 databases
in a format readable by the m4_db m4_ref(db_load) utility.
m4_p([dnl
The system libraries with which you are loading the m4_ref(db_dump185)
utility must already contain the m4_db 1.85 library routines for this
to work because the m4_db distribution does not include them.  If you
are using a non-standard library for the m4_db 1.85 library routines,
you will have to change the Makefile that the configuration step creates
to load the m4_ref(db_dump185) utility with that library.])])

m4_idefz(configuring the @Java API)
m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-java)], [dnl
To build the m4_db Java API, enter --enable-java as an argument to
configure. To build Java, you must also build with shared libraries.
Before configuring, you must set your PATH environment variable to
include javac.  Note that it is not sufficient to include a symbolic
link to javac in your PATH because the configuration process uses the
location of javac to determine the location of the Java include files
(for example, jni.h). On some systems, additional include directories
may be needed to process jni.h; see m4_link(flags, Changing compile or
load options) for more information.])

m4_idefz(configuring the fine-grained lock manager)
m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-fine_grained_lock_manager)], [dnl
For highly concurrent m4_db applications on multithreaded, multi-core
architectures (for example, Sun Microsystem's Niagara systems), it may
be advantageous to configure m4_db for finer-grained locking behavior
in the lock manager subsystem.  To build with m4_db with finer-grained
locking behavior in the lock manager subsystem, enter
--enable-fine_grained_lock_manager as an argument to configure.  This
option should not be configured without performance testing to confirm
the finer-grained locking behavior increases overall throughput, as this
option will decrease overall throughput for some applications.])

m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-posixmutexes)], [dnl
To force m4_db to use the POSIX pthread mutex interfaces for underlying
mutex support, enter --enable-posixmutexes as an argument to configure.
This is rarely necessary: POSIX mutexes will be selected automatically
on systems where they are the preferred implementation.
m4_p([dnl
The --enable-posixmutexes configuration argument is normally used in
two ways: First, when there are multiple mutex implementations available
and the POSIX mutex implementation is not the preferred one (for
example, on Solaris where the LWP mutexes are used by default).  Second,
by default the m4_db library will only select the POSIX mutex
implementation if it supports mutexes shared between multiple processes,
as described for the pthread_condattr_setpshared and
pthread_mutexattr_setpshared interfaces.  The --enable-posixmutexes
configuration argument can be used to force the selection of POSIX
mutexes in this case, which can improve application performance
significantly when the alternative mutex implementation is a
non-blocking one (for example test-and-set assembly instructions).
However, configuring to use POSIX mutexes when the implementation does
not have inter-process support will only allow the creation of private
database environments, that is, environments where the
m4_ref(DB_PRIVATE) flag is specified to the m4_refT(dbenv_open).])
m4_p([dnl
Specifying the --enable-posixmutexes configuration argument may require
that applications and m4_db be linked with the -lpthread library.])])

m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-pthread_api)], [dnl
To configure m4_db for a POSIX pthreads application (with the exception
that POSIX pthread mutexes may not be selected as the underlying mutex
implementation for the build), enter --enable-pthread_api as an argument
to configure.  The build will include the m4_db replication manager
interfaces and will use the POSIX standard pthread_self and
pthread_yield functions to identify threads of control and yield the
processor.  The --enable-pthread_api argument requires POSIX pthread
support already be installed on your system.
m4_p([dnl
Specifying the --enable-pthread_api configuration argument may require
that applications and m4_db be linked with the -lpthread library.])])

m4_idefz(configuring a @RPC client/server)
m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-rpc)], [dnl
To build the m4_db RPC client code and server utility, enter --enable-rpc
as an argument to configure.  The --enable-rpc argument requires that RPC
support already be installed on your system.])

m4_idefz(configuring a small memory @footprint library)
m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-smallbuild)], [dnl
To build a small memory footprint version of the m4_db library, enter
--enable-smallbuild as an argument to configure.  The
--enable-smallbuild argument is equivalent to individually specifying
--disable-cryptography, --disable-hash, --disable-queue,
--disable-replication, --disable-statistics and --disable-verify,
turning off cryptography support, the Hash and Queue access methods,
database environment replication support and database verification
support.  See m4_linkpage(M4RELDIR/ref/build_unix/small, Building a
small memory footprint library) for more information.])

m4_idefz(configuring the @Tcl API)
m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-tcl)], [dnl
To build the m4_db Tcl API, enter --enable-tcl as an argument to
configure.  This configuration argument expects to find Tcl's tclConfig.sh
file in the m4_path(/usr/local/lib) directory.  See the --with-tcl
argument for instructions on specifying a non-standard location for the
Tcl installation.  See m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/tcl/intro, Loading m4_db
with Tcl) for information on sites from which you can download Tcl and
which Tcl versions are compatible with m4_db.  To build Tcl, you must
also build with shared libraries.])

m4_idefz(configuring the @test suite)
m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-test)], [dnl
To build the m4_db test suite, enter --enable-test as an argument to
configure.  To run the m4_db test suite, you must also build the Tcl
API.  This argument should not be specified when configuring to build
production binaries.])

m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-uimutexes)], [dnl
To force m4_db to use the UNIX International (UI) mutex interfaces for
underlying mutex support, enter --enable-uimutexes as an argument to
configure.  This is rarely necessary: UI mutexes will be selected
automatically on systems where they are the preferred implementation.
m4_p([dnl
The --enable-uimutexes configuration argument is normally used when
there are multiple mutex implementations available and the UI mutex
implementation is not the preferred one (for example, on Solaris where
the LWP mutexes are used by default).])
m4_p([dnl
Specifying the --enable-uimutexes configuration argument may require
that applications and m4_db be linked with the -lthread library.])])

m4_tag([m4_idef(--enable-umrw)], [dnl
Rational Software's Purify product and other run-time tools complain
about uninitialized reads/writes of structure fields whose only purpose
is padding, as well as when heap memory that was never initialized is
written to disk.  Specify the --enable-umrw argument during
configuration to mask these errors.  This argument should not be
specified when configuring to build production binaries.])

m4_tag([m4_idef(--with-mutex=MUTEX)], [dnl
To force m4_db to use a specific mutex implementation, configure with
--with-mutex=MUTEX, where MUTEX is the mutex implementation you want.
For example, --with-mutex=x86/gcc-assembly will configure m4_db to use
the x86 GNU gcc compiler based test-and-set assembly mutexes.  This is
rarely necessary and should be done only when the default configuration
selects the wrong mutex implementation.  A list of available mutex
implementations can be found in the distribution file
m4_path(dist/aclocal/mutex.ac).])

m4_tag([m4_idef(--with-tcl=DIR)], [dnl
To build the m4_db Tcl API, enter --with-tcl=DIR, replacing DIR with
the directory in which the Tcl tclConfig.sh file may be found.  See
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/tcl/intro, Loading m4_db with Tcl) for information
on sites from which you can download Tcl and which Tcl versions are
compatible with m4_db.  To build Tcl, you must also build with shared
libraries.])

m4_tag([m4_idef(--with-uniquename=NAME)], [dnl
To build m4_db with unique symbol names (in order to avoid conflicts
with other application modules or libraries), enter --with-uniquename=NAME,
replacing NAME with a string that to be appended to every m4_db symbol.
If "=NAME" is not specified, a default value of "_MAJORMINOR" is used,
where MAJORMINOR is the major and minor release numbers of the m4_db
release.  See m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/install/multiple, Building with
multiple versions of m4_db) for more information.])
