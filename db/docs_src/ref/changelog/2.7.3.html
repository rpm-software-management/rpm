<b>-pthread</b> instead of directly loading with the <b>-lc_r</b> library.

<p><li>
Linux systems are now built using the <b>-D_REENTRANT</b> flag.

</ol>
<h3>Additional Changes:</h3>
<ol>

<p><li>
The default memory pool cache size has been increase from 128K to 256K.

</ol>
<h3>Additional Bug Fixes:</h3>
<ol>

<p><li>
Freeing memory allocated by the TCL library historically failed on Windows

TCL library and the Berkeley DB module.  (This change only affects the
Berkeley DB test suite.)
