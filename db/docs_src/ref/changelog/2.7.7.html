<h3 align=center>Berkeley DB 2.7.7 Change Log</h3>

Berkeley DB version 2.7.7 is version 2.7.5 with a set of specific bug
fixes applied.  There were no public interface changes or new features.

<h3>Bug Fixes:</h3>
<ol>

<p><li>
Fix potential races in updating checkpoint buffer counts that can
cause checkpoint calls to never finish.
<p><li>
Fix for XA support, allows two-phase commit processing to work.
<p><li>
Fix a recovery bug when database files are opened/closed multiple times in
the same session.
<p><li>
Change file descriptor usage to permit Sendmail's fcntl(2) locking scheme.
<p><li>
Fix ANSI C++ usage to avoid GNU gcc-2.95  warning messages.
<p><li>
If there are a sufficient number of threads competing for limited numbers
of pages, it's possible to split Btree pages too many times, and cause a
core dump.
<p><li>
Fix a case where it was possible for EAGAIN to not be returned from the
database get-by-key interface.
<p><li>
Ignore log records not involved in transactions so that actions taken
outside of transactions are not undone during recovery.
<p><li>
Fix a memory pool race during buffer discard in memory tight environments.
</ol>

<h3>Other Changes:</h3>
<ol>
<p><li>
Update the Berkeley DB release version numbers from 2.7.5 to 2.7.7.
</ol>
