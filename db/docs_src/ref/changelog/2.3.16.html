<h3 align=center>Berkeley DB 2.3.16 Change Log</h3>

<h3>Interface Changes Introduced in DB 2.3.16:</h3>

<ol>

<li>
The interface to <b>db_jump_set</b>(3) for the DB_FUNC_IOINFO value
has changed in order to avoid passing <b>off_t</b> types as interface
arguments.
Any software that uses this interface must be updated to use the new
arguments.
See
db_internal(3)
for more information.
<font color=red>
This change is NOT transparent to applications.
</font>

<p><li>
The output of <b>log_stat</b>(3) has been enhanced to include the
current log file number and offset within that file.
See
db_log(3)
for more information.

<p><li>
A new option, <b>-T</b>, has been added to the <b>db_load</b>(1) utility.
This option simplifies using non-DB applications (or scripts) to create
DB databases.
See
db_load(1)
for more information.

<p><li>
Applications wanting to us the dbm, ndbm or hsearch interfaces to
the DB library must now specify a numeric value when they #define
DB_DBM_HSEARCH.  For example, instead of using:
<p>
<ul><code>
#define DB_DBM_HSEARCH
<br>
#include "db.h"
</code></ul>
<p>
in the application, they must now use:
<p>
<ul><code>
#define DB_DBM_HSEARCH    1
<br>
#include "db.h"
</code></ul>
<p>
<font color=red>
This change is NOT transparent to applications.
</font>

<p><li>
DB no longer intrudes on the historic <b>dbm</b>(3), <b>ndbm</b>(3) or
<b>hsearch</b>(3) namespaces.  This change permits applications to load
the DB library and still load the <b>dbm</b>, <b>ndbm</b> or
<b>hsearch</b> functions from another library.

<p><li>
The <b>dbm</b>(3) functions are no longer exported in the Win32
environment.  The <b>db_jump_set</b>(3), <b>db_value_set</b>(3) and
<b>log_stat</b>(3) interfaces are now exported in the Win32 environment.

<p><li>
In the Java DB API, Dbt's used to retrieve data must specify
Db.DB_DBT_MALLOC or Db.DB_DBT_USERMEM in the Dbt flags.
If Db.DB_DBT_USERMEM is used, the data field of the Dbt must
be set to an appropriately sized byte array.

</ol>

<h3>Bug Fixes:</h3>

<ol>

<p><li>
When transaction undo was performed during recovery, the Btree access
method could incorrectly recover pages that were never created because
of the system or application failure.

<p><li>
When the last log file did not contain a checkpoint, recovery could
potentially fail.

<p><li>
When files were opened and closed between checkpoints, catastrophic
recovery could potentially fail.

<p><li>
When log file #2 existed but log file #1 did not, recovery would fail.

<p><li>
Shared memory regions were not being explicitly initialized in the Win95
environment, potentially resulting in unexpected behavior.

<p><li>
An incorrect shared memory region offset was being specified in the shared
memory buffer cache support for systems using <b>fcntl</b>(2) locking
(rather than spinlock mutexes).  This could potentially lead to incorrect
locking behavior in that subsystem.

<p><li>
The shared memory buffer cache had a deadlock situation when a buffer
writer and a thread or process syncing the pool attempted to write the
same buffer at the same time, potentially leading to thread/process
starvation.

<p><li>
The Java DB API did not correctly interact with the Db.DB_DBT_MALLOC
and Db.DB_DBT_USERMEM flags, and a number of memory leaks have been
eliminated.

</ol>

<h3>Additional Changes:</h3>

<ol>

<li>
There are a large number of source changes to the DB 2.3.16 release,
intended to clean up compiler warnings that could appear when various
debugging and warning options were specified to the gcc and Solaris
compilers.

<p><li>
DB 2.3.16 has been modified to never pass as arguments or store on disk
variables of type off_t.  This change is intended to increase DB's
portability to compiler/architecture combinations where the DB library
and the application may not have been compiled with the same size off_t.

<p><li>
DB now uses the -O2 compiler optimization flag when building on Linux
systems.

<p><li>
The shared memory buffer cache subsystem has been enhanced to no longer
hold mutex locks across calls to <b>fsync</b>(2).

<p><li>
The shared memory buffer cache subsystem now explicitly yields the
processor when waiting on a buffer for which I/O was being performed,
enhancing overall throughput.

<p><li>
The test suite has been enhanced to better test recovery and to increase
dbm/ndbm interface coverage.
