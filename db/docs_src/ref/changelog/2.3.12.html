<h3 align=center>Interface Changes introduced in DB 2.3.12:</h3>

<ol>

<li>
A new DB interface, <b>db_jump_set</b>(), has been added.  The
<b>db_jump_set</b> function enables applications to replace underlying
DB library functionality by replacing entries in a function call jump
table.  This interface is intended for applications needing to do
run-time linking to specific underlying libraries, for example, for
systems where the malloc(3) that the application will use is not known
until run-time.  The <b>db_yield</b> field previously found in the
DB_ENV structure has been removed, and its functionality incorporated
into the db_jump_set function.
<p>
<font color=red>
The removal of the db_yield field is NOT transparent to applications.
</font>
Applications should be converted from using the db_yield field to
calling the <b>db_jump_set</b>() function with the DB_FUNC_YIELD
flag.
If you have a support contract with Sleepycat Software, please contact
us for further information and assistance in migrating applications
from previous releases of DB to this release.
<p>
See db_jump(3) for more information.

<p><li>
A new memory pool interface, <b>memp_trickle</b>(), has been added.
The <b>memp_trickle</b> function permits an application to ensure
that a certain percentage of the pages in the shared memory pool
remain clean at all times, so that there are always buffers available
for reading in new pages from the backing files.
<p>
See db_mpool(3) for more information.

<p><li>
A new log region interface, <b>log_stat</b>(), has been added.
The <b>log_stat</b> function returns statistical information about
the log region.
The <b>db_stat</b>(1) utility has been updated to optionally display
this information.
<p>
See db_log(3) for more information.

<p><li>
There have been various additions to the memory pool statistics
structure, as returned by <b>memp_stat</b>() and displayed by
<b>db_stat</b>(1).
Applications using the memory pool statistics interface will need
to be recompiled for this release.
<p>
See db_mpool(3) for more information.
