<h3 align=center>Interface Changes introduced in DB 2.3.14:</h3>

<ol>

<li>
There was a mismatch in previous releases of DB between the
documented interface to <b>lock_detect</b>(3) (or
<b>DbLockTab::detect()</b>) and the DB software.  This mismatch
was resolved in favor of the source code.  Any software that
uses this interface should be checked to make sure that the
second argument is the "flags" argument, and the third argument is
the "atype" argument.
<font color=red>
This change may NOT be transparent to applications.
</font>

<p><li>
There is an new DB interface, <b>db_value_set</b>(), described in
db_internal(3).
The only purpose of the <b>db_value_set</b>() interface in the DB
2.3.14 release is to permit applications to set the number of spins
that mutexes will make before blocking, when a mutex is not immediately
available.  This is intended to permit applications on multi-CPU
architectures a finer granularity of control over mutexes.
As with <b>db_jump_set</b>(), <b>db_value_set</b>() is only available
from the C API, and is expected to be used by few applications.

<p><li>
We've added a Java API for DB.
The Java API should be considered a beta release,
and therefore more subject to change than normal.
We would very much appreciate email on any comments and/or experiences
you have in using the DB Java API!
