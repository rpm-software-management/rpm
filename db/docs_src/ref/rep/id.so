    Replication environment IDs,, rep/intro, rep/pri)

m4_p([dnl
Each database environment included in a replication group must have a
unique identifier for itself and for the other members of the
replication group.   The identifiers do not need to be global, that is,
each database environment can assign local identifiers to members of
the replication group as it encounters them.  For example, given three
sites: A, B and C, site A might assign the identifiers 1 and 2 to sites
B and C respectively, while site B might assign the identifiers 301 and
302 to sites A and C respectively.  Note that it is not wrong to have
global identifiers, it is just not a requirement.])

m4_p([dnl
It is the responsibility of the application to label each incoming
replication message passed to m4_refT(rep_message) with the appropriate
identifier.  Subsequently, m4_db will label outgoing messages to the
m4_arg(send) function with those same identifiers.])

m4_p([dnl
Negative identifiers are reserved for use by m4_db, and should never be
assigned to environments by the application.  Two of these reserved
identifiers are intended for application use, as follows:])

m4_tagbegin

m4_tag([m4_ref(DB_EID_BROADCAST)], [dnl
The m4_ref(DB_EID_BROADCAST) identifier indicates a message should be
broadcast to all members of a replication group.])

m4_tag([m4_ref(DB_EID_INVALID)], [dnl
The m4_ref(DB_EID_INVALID) identifier is an invalid environment ID, and
may be used to initialize environment ID variables that are subsequently
checked for validity.])

m4_tagend

m4_p([dnl
Replication Manager assigns and manages environment IDs on behalf of
the application.])
