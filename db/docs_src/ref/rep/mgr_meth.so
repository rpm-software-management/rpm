m4_ref_title(m4_db Replication,
    Replication Manager methods,, rep/app, rep/base_meth)

m4_p([dnl
Applications which use the Replication Manager support generally call
the following m4_db methods.  The general pattern is to call various
methods to configure Replication Manager, and then start it by calling
m4_ref(repmgr_start).  Once this initialization is complete, the
application rarely needs to call any of these methods.  (A prime
example of an exception to this rule would be the m4_refT(rep_sync),
if the application is doing m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/rep/mastersync,
delayed synchronization).)])

m4_tagbegin

m4_tag(m4_ref(repmgr_set_local_site), [dnl
The m4_refT(repmgr_set_local_site) configures the TCP/IP address of
the local site, by specifying the port number on which it is to listen
for incoming connection requests.  This method must be called exactly
once before calling m4_ref(repmgr_start).])

m4_tag(m4_ref(repmgr_add_remote_site), [dnl
The m4_refT(repmgr_add_remote_site) adds a remote site to the list of
sites initially known by the local site.  The remote site is specified
in terms of a TCP/IP network address: host name and port number.  This
method may be called as many times as necessary to configure all known
remote sites.  Note that it is usually not necessary for each site in
the replication group initially to know about all other sites in the
group.  Sites can discover each other dynamically, as described in
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/rep/newsite, Connecting to a new site).])

m4_tag(m4_ref(repmgr_set_ack_policy), [dnl
The m4_refT(repmgr_set_ack_policy) configures the acknowledgement
policy to be used in the replication group, in other words, the
behavior of the master with respect to acknowledgements for
"permanent" messages, which implements the application's requirements
for m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/rep/trans, transactional guarantees).  The
current implementation requires all sites in the replication group
configure the same acknowledgement policy.])

m4_tag(m4_ref(rep_set_nsites), [dnl
The m4_refT(rep_set_nsites) tells Replication Manager the total number
of sites in the replication group.  This is usually necessary for
proper operation of elections, and for counting message
acknowledgements (depending on the acknowledgement policy).])

m4_tag(m4_ref(rep_set_priority), [dnl
The m4_refT(rep_set_priority) configures the local site's priority for
the purpose of elections.])

m4_tag(m4_ref(rep_set_timeout), [dnl
This method optionally configures various timeout values.  Otherwise
default timeout values as specified in m4_ref(rep_set_timeout) are
used.])

m4_tag(m4_ref(dbenv_set_event_notify), [dnl
Once configured and started, Replication Manager does virtually all of
its work in the background, usually without the need for any direct
communication with the application.  However, occasionally events
occur which the application may be interested in knowing about.  The
application can request notification of these events by calling the
m4_refT(dbenv_set_event_notify).])

m4_tag(m4_ref(repmgr_start), [dnl
The m4_refT(repmgr_start) starts the replication system.  It opens the
listening TCP/IP socket and creates all the background processing
threads that will be needed.])

m4_tagend

m4_p([dnl
In addition to the methods previously described, Replication Manager
applications may also call the following methods, as needed:
m4_ref(rep_set_config), m4_ref(rep_set_limit), m4_ref(rep_sync),
m4_ref(rep_stat).])
