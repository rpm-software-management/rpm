m4_ref_title(Upgrading m4_db Applications,
    Upgrading m4_db installations,,
    upgrade/version, changelog/toc)

m4_p([dnl
The following information describes the general process of upgrading
m4_db installations.  There are four areas to be considered when
upgrading m4_db applications and database environments: the application
API, the database environment's region files, the underlying database
formats, and, in the case of transactional database environments, the
log files.  The upgrade procedures required depend on whether or not
the release is a major or minor release (in which either the major or
minor number of the version changed), or a patch release (in which only
the patch number in the version changed).  m4_db major and minor
releases may optionally include changes in all four areas, that is, the
application API, region files, database formats, and log files may not
be backward-compatible with previous releases.])

m4_p([dnl
Each m4_db major or minor release has information in this chapter of
the Reference Guide, describing how to upgrade to the new release.  The
section describes any API changes made in the release.  Application
maintainers should review the API changes and update their applications
as necessary before recompiling with the new release.  In addition, each
section includes a page specifying whether the log file format or
database formats changed in non-backward-compatible ways as part of the
release.  Because there are several underlying m4_db database formats,
and they do not all necessarily change in the same release, changes to
a database format in a release may not affect any particular
application.  Further, database and log file formats may have changed
but be entirely backward-compatible, in which case no upgrade will be
necessary.])

m4_p([dnl
A m4_db patch release will never modify the API, regions, log files, or
database formats in incompatible ways, and so applications need only be
relinked (or, in the case of a shared library, pointed at the new
version of the shared library) to upgrade to a new release.  Note that
internal m4_db interfaces may change at any time and in any release
(including patch releases) without warning.  This means the library must
be entirely recompiled and reinstalled when upgrading to new releases
of the library because there is no guarantee that modules from one
version of the library will interact correctly with modules from another
release.  We recommend using the same compiler release when building
patch releases as was used to build the original release; in the default
configuration, the m4_db library shares data structures from underlying
shared memory between threads of control, and should the compiler
re-order fields or otherwise change those data structures between the
two builds, errors may result.])

m4_p([If the release is a patch release, do the following:])

m4_nlistbegin
m4_nlist([Shut down the old version of the application.])
m4_nlistns([dnl
Install the new version of the application by relinking or installing
a new version of the m4_db shared library.])

m4_p([dnl
Otherwise, if the application has a m4_db transactional environment,
but neither the log file nor database formats need upgrading, the
application may be installed in the field using the following steps:])

m4_nlist([Shut down the old version of the application.])
m4_nlistns([dnl

m4_p([dnl
If the application has a m4_db transactional environment, and the log
files need upgrading but the databases do not, the application may be
installed in the field using the following steps:])

m4_nlistbegin
m4_nlist([Shut down the old version of the application.])
m4_nlistns([dnl
Still using the old version of m4_db, run recovery on the database
environment using the m4_refT(dbenv_open) or the m4_ref(db_recover)
utility.])
m4_nlistns([dnl
If you used the m4_refT(dbenv_open) to run recovery, make sure that the
m4_db environment is removed using the m4_refT(dbenv_remove) or an
appropriate system utility. ])
m4_nlistns([dnl
Archive the database environment for catastrophic recovery.  See
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/transapp/archival, Archival procedures) for more
information.])
m4_nlistns([Recompile and install the new version of the application.])
m4_nlistns([Force a checkpoint using the m4_refT(txn_checkpoint) or the
m4_ref(db_checkpoint) utility. If you use the m4_ref(db_checkpoint)
utility, make sure to use the new version of the utility; that is, the
version that came with the release of m4_db to which you are upgrading.])

m4_nlistns([dnl
Archive the database for catastrophic recovery again (using different
media than before, of course).  Note: This archival is not strictly
necessary.  However, if you have to perform catastrophic recovery after
restarting the application, that recovery must be done based on the
last archive you have made.  If you make this second archive, you can
use it as the basis of that catastrophic recovery.  If you do not make
this second archive, you have to use the archive you made in step 4 as
the basis of your recovery, and you have to do a full upgrade on it
before you can apply log files created after the upgrade to it.])
m4_nlistns([Force a checkpoint using the m4_refT(txn_checkpoint) or the
m4_ref(db_checkpoint) utility. If you use the m4_ref(db_checkpoint)

m4_nlistns([Restart the application.])

m4_p([dnl
Finally, upgrading a m4_db replication group requires a few additional
steps.  To upgrade a replication group, you must:])

m4_nlistbegin
m4_nlist([Bring all clients up to date with the master (that is, all
clients must be brought up to the most current log record as measured
by the master's log sequence number (LSN)).])
m4_nlistns([Perform the upgrade procedures described previously on each
of the individual database environments that are part of the replication
group.])
m4_nlistns([Restart the replication group.])
m4_nlistend

m4_p([dnl
Alternatively, it may be simpler to discard the contents of all of the
client database environments, upgrade the master database environment,
and then re-add all of the clients to the replication group using the
standard replication procedures for new sites.])
