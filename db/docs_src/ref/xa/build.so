m4_ref_title(Distributed Transactions,
    Building a Global Transaction Manager, [Transaction Manager],
    xa/intro, xa/xa_intro)

m4_p([dnl
Managing distributed transactions and using the two-phase commit
protocol of m4_db from an application requires the application provide
the functionality of a global transaction manager (GTM).  The GTM is
responsible for the following:])

m4_bullet([dnl
Communicating with the multiple environments (potentially on separate
systems).])
m4_bullet([Managing the global transaction ID name space.])
m4_bullet([Maintaining state information about each distributed transaction.])

m4_section([Communicating with multiple m4_db environments])

m4_p([dnl
Two-phase commit is required if an application wants to transaction
protect m4_db calls across multiple environments.  If the environments
reside on the same machine, the application can communicate with each
environment through its own address space with no additional complexity.
If the environments reside on separate machines, the application can
either use the m4_db RPC server to manage the remote environments or it
may use its own messaging capability, translating messages on the remote
machine into calls into the m4_db library (including the recovery
calls).  For some applications, it might be sufficient to use Tcl's
remote invocation to remote copies of the tclsh utility into which the
m4_db library has been dynamically loaded.])

m4_section([Managing the Global Transaction ID (GID) name space])

m4_p([dnl
A global transaction is a transaction that spans multiple environments.
Each global transaction must have a unique transaction ID.  This unique
ID is the global transaction ID (GID).  In m4_db, global transaction
IDs must be represented with the confines of a m4_ref(DB_XIDDATASIZE)
size (currently 128 bytes) array.  It is the responsibility of the
global transaction manager to assign GIDs, guarantee their uniqueness,
and manage the mapping of local transactions to GID.  That is, for each
GID, the GTM should know which local transactions managers participated.
The m4_db logging system or a m4_db table could be used to record this
information.])

m4_section([Maintaining state for each distributed transaction.])

m4_p([dnl
In addition to knowing which local environments participate in each
global transaction, the GTM must also know the state of each active
global transaction.  As soon as a transaction becomes distributed (that
is, a second environment participates), the GTM must record the
existence of the global transaction and all participants (whether this
must reside on stable storage or not depends on the exact configuration
of the system).  As new environments participate, the GTM must keep this
information up to date.])

m4_p([dnl
When the GTM is ready to begin commit processing, it should issue
m4_ref(txn_prepare) calls to each participating environment, indicating
the GID of the global transaction.  Once all the participants have
successfully prepared, then the GTM must record that the global
transaction will be committed.   This record should go to stable
storage.  Once written to stable storage, the GTM can send
m4_ref(txn_commit) requests to each participating environment.  Once
all environments have successfully completed the commit, the GTM can
either record the successful commit or can somehow "forget" the global
transaction.])

m4_p([dnl
If nested transactions are used (that is, the m4_arg(parent) parameter
is specified to m4_ref(txn_begin)), no m4_ref(txn_prepare) call should
be made on behalf of any child transaction.  Only the ultimate parent
should even issue a m4_ref(txn_prepare).
])

m4_p([dnl
Should any participant fail to prepare, then the GTM must abort the
global transaction.  The fact that the transaction is going to be
aborted should be written to stable storage.  Once written, the GTM can
then issue m4_ref(txn_abort) requests to each environment.  When all
aborts have returned successfully, the GTM can either record the
successful abort or "forget" the global transaction.])

m4_p([dnl
In summary, for each transaction, the GTM must maintain the following:])

m4_bulletbegin
m4_bullet([A list of participating environments])
m4_bullet([dnl
The current state of each transaction (pre-prepare, preparing,
committing, aborting, done)])
m4_bulletend

m4_section([Recovering from the failure of a single environment])

m4_p([dnl
If a single environment fails, there is no need to bring down or recover
other environments (the only exception to this is if all environments
are managed in the same application address space and there is a risk
the failure of the environment corrupted other environments).  Instead,
once the failing environment comes back up, it should be recovered (that
is, conventional recovery, via m4_ref(db_recover) or by specifying the
m4_ref(DB_RECOVER) flag to m4_ref(dbenv_open) should be run).  If the
m4_ref(db_recover) utility is used, then the -e option must be
specified.  In this case, the application will almost certainly want to
specify environmental parameters via a DB_CONFIG file in the
environment's home directory, so that m4_ref(db_recover) can create an
appropriately configured environment.  If the m4_ref(db_recover) utility
is not used, then m4_ref(DB_PRIVATE) should not be specified, unless
all processing including recovery, calls to m4_ref(txn_recover), and
calls to finish prepared, but not yet complete transactions take place
using the same database environment handle.  The GTM should then issue
a m4_ref(txn_recover) call to the environment.  This call will return
a list of prepared, but not yet committed or aborted transactions.  For
each transaction, the GTM should look up the GID in its local store to
determine if the transaction should commit or abort.])

m4_p([dnl
If the GTM is running in a system with multiple GTMs, it is possible
that some of the transactions returned via m4_ref(txn_recover) do not
belong to the current environment.  The GTM should detect this and call
m4_ref(txn_discard) on each such transaction handle.  Furthermore, it
is important to note the environment does not retain information about
which GTM has issued m4_ref(txn_recover) operations.  Therefore, each
GTM should issue all its m4_ref(txn_recover) calls, before another GTM
issues its calls.  If the calls are interleaved, each GTM may not get
a complete and consistent set of transactions.  The simplest way to
enforce this is for each GTM to make sure it can receive all its
outstanding transactions in a single m4_ref(txn_recover) call.  The
maximum number of possible outstanding transactions is roughly the
maximum number of active transactions in the environment (which value
can be obtained using the m4_refT(txn_stat) or the m4_ref(db_stat)
utility).  To simplify this procedure, the caller should allocate an
array large enough to be certain to hold the list of transactions (for
example, allocate an array able to hold three times the maximum number
of transactions).  If that's not possible, callers should check that the
array was not completely filled in when m4_ref(txn_recover) returns.
If the array was completely filled in, each transaction should be
explicitly discarded, and the call repeated with a larger array.])

m4_p([dnl
The newly recovered environment will forbid any new transactions from
being started until the prepared but not yet committed/aborted
transactions have been resolved.  In the multiple GTM case, this means
that all GTMs must recover before any GTM can begin issuing new transactions.])

m4_p([dnl
Because m4_db flushed both commit and abort records to disk for
two-phase transaction, once the global transaction has either committed
or aborted, no action will be necessary in any environment.  If local
environments are running with the m4_ref(DB_TXN_WRITE_NOSYNC) or
m4_ref(DB_TXN_NOSYNC) options (that is, is not writing and/or flushing
the log synchronously at commit time), then it is possible that a commit
or abort operation may not have been written in the environment.  In
this case, the GTM must always have a record of completed transactions
to determine if prepared transactions should be committed or aborted.])

m4_section([Recovering from GTM failure])

m4_p([dnl
If the GTM fails, it must first recover its local state.  Assuming the
GTM uses m4_db tables to maintain state, it should run
m4_ref(db_recover) (or the m4_ref(DB_RECOVER) option to
m4_ref(dbenv_open)) upon startup.  Once the GTM is back up and running,
it needs to review all its outstanding global transactions, that is all
transaction which are recorded, but not yet committed or aborted.])

m4_p([dnl
Any global transactions which have not yet reached the prepare phase
should be aborted.  If these transactions were on remote systems, the
remote systems should eventually time them out and abort them.  If these
transactions are on the local system, we assume they crashed and were
aborted as part of GTM startup.])

m4_p([dnl
The GTM must then identify all environments which need to have their
m4_refT(txn_recover)s called.  This includes all environments that
participated in any transaction that is in the preparing, aborting, or
committing state.  For each environment, the GTM should issue a
m4_ref(txn_recover) call.  Once each environment has responded, the GTM
can determine the fate of each transaction.  The correct behavior is
defined depending on the state of the global transaction according to
the table below.])

m4_tagbegin
m4_tag(preparing, [dnl
if all participating environments return the transaction in the prepared
but not yet committed/aborted state, then the GTM should commit the
transaction.  If any participating environment fails to return it, then
the GTM should issue an abort to all environments that did return it.])
m4_tag(committing, [dnl
the GTM should send a commit to any environment that returned this
transaction in its list of prepared but not yet committed/aborted
transactions.])
m4_tag(aborting, [dnl
the GTM should send an abort to any environment that returned this
transaction in its list of prepared but not yet committed/aborted
transactions.])
