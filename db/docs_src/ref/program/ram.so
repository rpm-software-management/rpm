m4_p([dnl
m4_db supports a variety of memory-based configurations for systems
where filesystem space is either limited in availability or entirely
replaced by some combination of memory and Flash.  In addition, m4_db
can be configured to minimize writes to the filesystem when the
filesystem is backed by Flash memory.])

m4_p([dnl
There are three parts of the m4_db database environment normally written
to the filesystem: the database environment region files, the database
files and the database environment log files.  Each of these items can
be configured to live in memory rather than in the filesystem:])

m4_tagbegin

m4_tag([The database environment region files:], [dnl
Each of the m4_db subsystems in a database environment is described by
one or more regions, or chunks of memory. The regions contain all of the
per-process and per-thread shared information (including mutexes), that
comprise a m4_db environment.  By default, these regions are backed by
the filesystem.  In situations where filesystem backed regions aren't
optimal, applications can create memory-only database environments in
two different types of memory: either in the application's heap memory
or in system shared memory.

m4_p([dnl
To create the database environment in heap memory, specify the
m4_ref(DB_PRIVATE) flag to the m4_refT(dbenv_open).  Note that database
environments created in heap memory are only accessible to the threads
of a single process, however.])

m4_p([dnl
To create the database environment in system shared memory, specify the
m4_ref(DB_SYSTEM_MEM) flag to the m4_refT(dbenv_open).  Database
environments created in system memory are accessible to multiple
processes, but note that database environments created in system shared
memory do create a small (roughly 8 byte) file in the filesystem, read
by the processes to identify which system shared memory segments to
use.])

memory regions]).])])

m4_tag([The database files:], [dnl
By default, databases are periodically flushed from the m4_db memory
cache to backing physical files in the filesystem.  To keep databases
from being written to backing physical files, pass the
m4_ref(DB_MPOOL_NOFILE) flag to the m4_refT(memp_set_flags).  This flag
implies the application's databases must fit entirely in the m4_db
cache, of course.  To avoid a database file growing to consume the
entire cache, applications can limit the size of individual databases
in the cache by calling the m4_refT(memp_set_maxsize).])

m4_tag([The database environment log files:], [dnl
If a database environment is not intended to be transactionally
recoverable after application or system failure (that is, if it will not
exhibit the transactional attribute of "durability"), applications
should not configure the database environment for logging or
transactions, in which case no log files will be created.  If the
database environment is intended to be durable, log files must either
be written to stable storage and recovered after application or system
failure, or they must be replicated to other systems.

m4_p([dnl
In applications running on systems without any form of stable storage,
durability must be accomplished through replication.  In this case,
database environments should be configured to maintain database logs in
memory, rather than in the filesystem, by specifying the
m4_ref(DB_LOG_INMEMORY) flag to the m4_refT(dbenv_set_flags).])])

m4_tagend

m4_p([dnl
In systems where the filesystem is backed by Flash memory, the number
of times the Flash memory is written may be a concern.  Each of the
three parts of the m4_db database environment normally written to the
filesystem can be configured to minimize the number of times the
filesystem is written:])

m4_tagbegin

m4_tag([The database environment region files:], [dnl
On a Flash-based filesystem, the database environment should be placed
in heap or system memory, as described previously.])

m4_tag([The database files:], [dnl
The m4_db library maintains a cache of database pages.  The database
pages are only written to backing physical files when the application
checkpoints the database environment with the m4_refT(txn_checkpoint),
when database handles are closed with the m4_refT(dbh_close), or when
the application explicitly flushes the cache with the m4_ref(dbh_sync)
or m4_refT(memp_sync)s.

m4_p([dnl
To avoid unnecessary writes of Flash memory due to checkpoints,
applications should decrease the frequency of their checkpoints.  This
is especially important in applications which repeatedly modify a
specific database page, as repeatedly writing a database page to the
backing physical file will repeatedly update the same blocks of the
filesystem.])

m4_p([dnl
To avoid unnecessary writes of the filesystem due to closing a database
handle, applications should specify the m4_ref(DB_NOSYNC) flag to the
m4_refT(dbh_close).])

m4_p([dnl
To avoid unnecessary writes of the filesystem due to flushing the cache,
applications should not explicitly flush the cache under normal
conditions -- flushing the cache is rarely if ever needed in a
normally-running application.])])

m4_tag([The database environment log files:], [dnl
The m4_db log files do not repeatedly overwrite the same blocks of the
filesystem as the m4_db log files are not implemented as a circular
buffer and log files are not re-used.  For this reason, the m4_db log
files should not cause any difficulties for Flash memory configurations.

m4_p([dnl
However, as m4_db does not write log records in filesystem block sized
pieces, it is probable that sequential transaction commits (each of
which flush the log file to the backing filesystem), will write a block
of Flash memory twice, as the last log record from the first commit will
write the same block of Flash memory as the first log record from the
second commit.  Applications not requiring absolute durability should
specify the m4_ref(DB_TXN_WRITE_NOSYNC) or m4_ref(DB_TXN_NOSYNC) flags
to the m4_refT(dbenv_set_flags) to avoid this overwrite of a block of
Flash memory.])])
