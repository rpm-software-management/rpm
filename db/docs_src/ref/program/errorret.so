    Error returns to applications,

m4_p([dnl
Except for the historic m4_ref(dbm), m4_ref(ndbm), and m4_ref(hsearch)
interfaces, m4_db does not use the global variable m4_envvar(errno) to
return error values.  The return values for all m4_db functions are
grouped into the following three categories:])

m4_tagbegin
m4_tag(0, [A return value of 0 indicates that the operation was successful.])

m4_tag([__GT__ 0], [dnl
A return value that is greater than 0 indicates that there was a system
error.  The m4_bold(errno) value returned by the system is returned by
the function; for example, when a m4_db function is unable to allocate
memory, the return value from the function will be ENOMEM.])

m4_tag([__LT__ 0], [dnl
A return value that is less than 0 indicates a condition that was not
a system failure, but was not an unqualified success, either.  For
example, a routine to retrieve a key/data pair from the database may
return m4_ref(DB_NOTFOUND) when the key/data pair does not appear in
the database; as opposed to the value of 0, which would be returned if
the key/data pair were found in the database.
m4_p([dnl
m4_idefz(error name space)
All values returned by m4_db functions are less than 0 in order to avoid
conflict with possible values of m4_bold(errno).  Specifically, m4_db
reserves all values from -30,800 to -30,999 to itself as possible error
values.  There are a few m4_db interfaces where it is possible for an
application function to be called by a m4_db function and subsequently
fail with an application-specific return.  Such failure returns will be
passed back to the function that originally called a m4_db interface.
To avoid ambiguity about the cause of the error, error values separate
from the m4_db error name space should be used.])])
m4_tagend

m4_p([dnl
Although possible error returns are specified by each individual function's
manual page, there are a few error returns that deserve general mention:])

m4_section(m4_idef(DB_NOTFOUND) and m4_idef(DB_KEYEMPTY))
m4_p([dnl
There are two special return values that are similar in meaning and that
are returned in similar situations, and therefore might be confused:
m4_ref(DB_NOTFOUND) and m4_ref(DB_KEYEMPTY).])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(DB_NOTFOUND) error return indicates that the requested key/data
pair did not exist in the database or that start-of- or end-of-file has
been reached by a cursor.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(DB_KEYEMPTY) error return indicates that the requested
key/data pair logically exists but was never explicitly created by the
application (the Recno and Queue access methods will automatically
create key/data pairs under some circumstances; see m4_ref(dbh_open)
for more information), or that the requested key/data pair was deleted
and never re-created.  In addition, the Queue access method will return
m4_ref(DB_KEYEMPTY) for records that were created as part of a
transaction that was later aborted and never re-created.])

m4_section(m4_idef(DB_KEYEXIST))
m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(DB_KEYEXIST) error return indicates the m4_ref(DB_NOOVERWRITE)
option was specified when inserting a key/data pair into the database and
the key already exists in the database, or the m4_ref(DB_NODUPDATA)
option was specified and the key/data pair already exists in the data.])

m4_idefz(DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK)
m4_section(m4_idef(DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK))
m4_p([dnl
When multiple threads of control are modifying the database, there is
normally the potential for deadlock. In m4_db, deadlock is signified by
an error return from the m4_db function of the value
m4_ref(DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK).  Whenever a m4_db function returns
m4_ref(DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK), the enclosing transaction should be aborted.])

m4_p([dnl
Any m4_db function that attempts to acquire locks can potentially return
m4_ref(DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK).  Practically speaking, the safest way to deal
with applications that can deadlock is to anticipate a
m4_ref(DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK) return from any m4_ref(Db) or m4_ref(Dbc)
handle method call, or any m4_ref(DbEnv) handle method call that
references a database, including the database's backing physical file.])

m4_section(m4_idef(DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED))
m4_p([dnl
If a lock is requested from the m4_ref(lock_get) or m4_refT(lock_vec)s
with the m4_ref(DB_LOCK_NOWAIT) flag specified, the method will return
m4_ref(DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED) if the lock is not immediately available.])
m4_p([dnl
If the m4_ref(DB_TIME_NOTGRANTED) flag is specified to the
m4_refT(dbenv_set_flags), database calls timing out based on lock or
transaction timeout values will return m4_ref(DB_LOCK_NOTGRANTED)
instead of m4_ref(DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK).])

m4_section(m4_idef(DB_RUNRECOVERY))
m4_p([dnl
There exists a class of errors that m4_db considers fatal to an entire
m4_db environment.  An example of this type of error is a corrupted
database page.  The only way to recover from these failures is to have
all threads of control exit the m4_db environment, run recovery of the
environment, and re-enter m4_db. (It is not strictly necessary that the
processes exit, although that is the only way to recover system
resources, such as file descriptors and memory, allocated by m4_db.)])

m4_p([dnl
When this type of error is encountered, the error value
m4_ref(DB_RUNRECOVERY) is returned. This error can be returned by any
m4_db interface.  Once m4_ref(DB_RUNRECOVERY) is returned by any
interface, it will be returned from all subsequent m4_db calls made by
any threads of control participating in the environment.])

m4_p([dnl
Applications can handle such fatal errors in one of two ways: first, by
checking for m4_ref(DB_RUNRECOVERY) as part of their normal m4_db error
return checking, similarly to m4_ref(DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK) or any other
error.  Alternatively, applications can specify a fatal-error callback
function using the m4_refT(dbenv_set_event_notify).  Applications with
no cleanup processing of their own should simply exit from the callback
function.])
