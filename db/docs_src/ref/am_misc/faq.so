m4_bold([Is a m4_db database the same as a "table"?])

m4_p([dnl
Yes; "tables" are databases, "rows" are key/data pairs, and "columns"
are application-encapsulated fields within a data item (to which m4_db
does not directly provide access).])])

figure out what the library is complaining about.])

m4_ref(dbh_set_errfile) for ways to get additional information about
error returns from m4_db.])])

m4_bold([Are m4_db databases portable between architectures?])

Yes.  See m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/am_conf/byteorder, [Selecting a byte
order]) for more information.])])

m4_nlist([dnl
m4_bold([I'm seeing database corruption when creating multiple databases
in a single physical file.])

m4_p([dnl
This problem is usually the result of m4_ref(Db) handles not sharing an
underlying database environment.  See m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/am/opensub,
[Opening multiple databases in a single file]) for more information.])])

m4_nlist([dnl
m4_bold([I'm using integers as keys for a Btree database, and even
though the key/data pairs are entered in sorted order, the page-fill
factor is low.])

m4_p([dnl
This is usually the result of using integer keys on little-endian
architectures such as the x86.  m4_db sorts keys as byte strings, and
little-endian integers don't sort well when viewed as byte strings.
For example, take the numbers 254 through 257.  Their byte patterns on
a little-endian system are:])

m4_indent([dnl
254	fe 0 0 0
255	ff 0 0 0
256	 0 1 0 0
257	 1 1 0 0])

m4_p([dnl
If you treat them as strings, then they sort badly:])

m4_indent([dnl
256
257
254
255])

m4_p([dnl
On a big-endian system, their byte patterns are:])

m4_indent([dnl
254	0 0 0 fe
255	0 0 0 ff
256	0 0 1 0
257	0 0 1 1])

m4_p([dnl
and so, if you treat them as strings they sort nicely.  Which means, if
you use steadily increasing integers as keys on a big-endian system
m4_db behaves well and you get compact trees, but on a little-endian
system m4_db produces much less compact trees.  To avoid this problem,
you may want to convert the keys to flat text or big-endian
representations, or provide your own
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/am_conf/bt_compare, [Btree comparison function.])])])

m4_idefz(double buffering)
m4_nlist([dnl
m4_bold([Is there any way to avoid double buffering in the m4_db system?])

m4_p([dnl
While you cannot avoid double buffering entirely, there are a few things
you can do to address this issue:])
m4_p([dnl
First, the m4_db cache size can be explicitly set.  Rather than allocate
additional space in the m4_db cache to cover unexpectedly heavy load or
large table sizes, double buffering may suggest you size the cache to
function well under normal conditions, and then depend on the file
buffer cache to cover abnormal conditions.  Obviously, this is a
trade-off, as m4_db may not then perform as well as usual under abnormal
conditions.])
m4_p([dnl
Second, depending on the underlying operating system you're using, you
may be able to alter the amount of physical memory devoted to the
system's file buffer cache.  Altering this type of resource
configuration may require appropriate privileges, or even operating
system reboots and/or rebuilds, on some systems.])

m4_p([dnl
Third, changing the size of the m4_db environment regions can change
the amount of space the operating system makes available for the file
buffer cache, and it's often worth considering exactly how the operating
system is dividing up its available memory.  Further, moving the m4_db
database environment regions from filesystem backed memory into system
memory (or heap memory), can often make additional system memory
available for the file buffer cache, especially on systems without a
unified buffer cache and VM system.])
m4_p([dnl
Finally, for operating systems that allow buffering to be turned off,
specifying the m4_ref(DB_DIRECT_DB) and m4_ref(DB_DIRECT_LOG) flags
will attempt to do so.])])

m4_nlist([dnl
m4_bold([I'm seeing database corruption when I run out of disk space.])

m4_p([dnl
m4_db can continue to run when when out-of-disk-space errors occur, but
it requires the application to be transaction protected.  Applications
which do not enclose update operations in transactions cannot recover
from out-of-disk-space errors, and the result of running out of disk
space may be database corruption.])])

m4_nlist([dnl
m4_bold([How can I associate application information with a m4_ref(Db)
or m4_ref(DbEnv) handle?])

m4_p([dnl
In the C API, the m4_ref(Db) and m4_ref(DbEnv) structures each contain
an "app_private" field intended to be used to reference
application-specific information.  See the m4_ref(dbh_create) and
m4_ref(dbenv_create) documentation for more information.])

m4_p([dnl
In the C++ or Java APIs, the easiest way to associate
application-specific data with a handle is to subclass the m4_refcxx(Db)
or m4_refcxx(DbEnv), for example subclassing m4_refcxx(Db) to get MyDb.
Objects of type MyDb will still have the m4_db API methods available on
them, and you can put any extra data or methods you want into the MyDb
class.  If you are using "callback" APIs that take m4_refcxx(Db) or
m4_refcxx(DbEnv) arguments (for example, m4_refcxx(dbh_set_bt_compare))
these will always be called with the m4_refcxx(Db) or m4_refcxx(DbEnv)
objects you create.  So if you always use MyDb objects, you will be able
to take the first argument to the callback function and cast it to a
MyDb (in C++, cast it to (MyDb*)).  That will allow you to access your
data members or methods.])])
