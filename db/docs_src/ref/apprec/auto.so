    Automatically generated functions,,
    apprec/def, apprec/config)

m4_p([dnl
The XXX.src file is processed using the gen_rec.awk script included in
the dist directory of the m4_db distribution.  This is an awk script
that is executed from with the following command line:])

m4_indent([dnl
awk -f gen_rec.awk \
	-v source_file=m4_italic(C_FILE) \
	-v header_file=m4_italic(H_FILE) \
	-v template_file=m4_italic(TMP_FILE) __LT__ XXX.src])

m4_p([dnl
where m4_italic(C_FILE) is the name of the file into which to place the
automatically generated C code, m4_italic(H_FILE) is the name of the
file into which to place the automatically generated data structures
and declarations, and m4_italic(TMP_FILE) is the name of the file into
which to place a template for the recovery routines.])

m4_p([dnl
Because the gen_rec.awk script uses sources files located relative to
the m4_db dist directory, it must be run from the dist directory.  For
example, in building the m4_db logging and recovery routines for
ex_apprec, the following script is used to rebuild the automatically
generated files:])

m4_indent([dnl
E=../examples_c/ex_apprec
m4_blank
cd ../../dist
awk -f gen_rec.awk \
    -v source_file=$E/ex_apprec_auto.c \
    -v header_file=$E/ex_apprec_auto.h \
    -v print_file=$E/ex_apprec_autop.c \
    -v template_file=$E/ex_apprec_template __LT__ $E/ex_apprec.src])

m4_p([dnl
For each log record description found in the XXX.src file, the following
structure declarations and #defines will be created in the file
m4_italic(header_file):])

m4_indent([dnl
#define DB_PREFIX_RECORD_TYPE        /* Integer ID number */
m4_blank
typedef struct _PREFIX_RECORD_TYPE_args {
    /*
     * These three fields are generated for every record.
     */
    u_int32_t type;      /* Record type used for dispatch. */
m4_blank
    /*
     * Transaction handle that identifies the transaction on whose
     * behalf the record is being logged.
     */
    DB_TXN *txnid;
m4_blank
    /*
     * The log sequence number returned by the previous call to log_put
     * for this transaction.
     */
    DB_LSN *prev_lsn;
m4_blank
    /*
     * The rest of the structure contains one field for each of
     * the entries in the record statement.
     */
};])

m4_p([dnl
Thus, the auto-generated ex_apprec_mkdir_args structure looks as follows:])

m4_indent([dnl
typedef struct _ex_apprec_mkdir_args {
	u_int32_t type;
	DB_TXN *txnid;
	DB_LSN prev_lsn;
	DBT	dirname;
} ex_apprec_mkdir_args;])

m4_p([dnl
The template_file will contain a template for a recovery function.  The
recovery function is called on each record read from the log during
system recovery, transaction abort, or the application of log records
on a replication client, and is expected to redo or undo the operations
described by that record.  The details of the recovery function will be
specific to the record being logged and need to be written manually,
but the template provides a good starting point.  (Note that the
template assumes that the record is manipulating the internals of a
m4_db database and sets up database handles, page structures, and such
for convenience.  Many application-specific log records will not need
these, and may simply delete much of the template.  See
ex_apprec_template and ex_apprec_rec.c for an example.)])

m4_p([dnl
The template file should be copied to a source file in the application
(but not the automatically generated source_file, as that will get
overwritten each time gen_rec.awk is run) and fully developed there.
The recovery function takes the following parameters:])

m4_indentv([dnl
m4_tagbegin

m4_tag(dbenv, [The environment in which recovery is running.])
m4_tag(rec, [The record being recovered.])
m4_tag(lsn, [The log sequence number of the record being recovered.  The
prev_lsn field, automatically included in every auto-generated log
record, should be returned through this argument.  The prev_lsn field
is used to chain log records together to allow transaction aborts;
because the recovery function is the only place that a log record gets
parsed, the responsibility for returning this value lies with the
recovery function writer.])
m4_tag(op, [dnl
A parameter of type db_recops, which indicates what operation is being
run (m4_ref(DB_TXN_ABORT), m4_ref(DB_TXN_APPLY), m4_ref(DB_TXN_BACKWARD_ROLL),
m4_ref(DB_TXN_FORWARD_ROLL) or m4_ref(DB_TXN_PRINT)).])
m4_tag(info, [dnl
A structure passed by the dispatch function.  It is used to contain a
list of committed transactions and information about files that may have
been deleted.  Application-specific log records can usually simply
ignore this field.])

m4_tagend])

m4_p([dnl
In addition to the header_file and template_file, a source_file is
created, containing a log, read, recovery, and print function for each
record type.])

m4_p([dnl
The log function marshalls the parameters into a buffer, and calls
m4_ref(log_put) on that buffer returning 0 on success and non-zero on
failure.  The log function takes the following parameters:])

m4_indentv([dnl
m4_tagbegin

m4_tag(dbenv, [The environment in which recovery is running.])
m4_tag(txnid, [dnl
The transaction identifier for the transaction handle returned by
m4_ref(txn_begin).])
m4_tag(lsnp, [dnl
A pointer to storage for a log sequence number into which the log
sequence number of the new log record will be returned.])
m4_tag(syncflag, [dnl
A flag indicating whether the record must be written synchronously.
Valid values are 0 and m4_ref(DB_FLUSH).])
m4_tag(args, [dnl
The remaining parameters to the log message are the fields described
in the XXX.src file, in order.])

m4_tagend])

m4_p([dnl
The read function takes a buffer and unmarshalls its contents into a
structure of the appropriate type.  It returns 0 on success and non-zero
on error.  After the fields of the structure have been used, the pointer
returned from the read function should be freed.  The read function
takes the following parameters:])

m4_indentv([dnl
m4_tagbegin

m4_tag(dbenv, [The environment in which recovery is running.])
m4_tag(recbuf, [A buffer.])
m4_tag(argp, [A pointer to a structure of the appropriate type.])

m4_tagend])

m4_p([dnl
The print function displays the contents of the record.  The print
function takes the same parameters as the recovery function described
previously.  Although some of the parameters are unused by the print
function, taking the same parameters  allows a single dispatch loop to
dispatch to a variety of functions.  The print function takes the
following parameters:])

m4_indentv([dnl
m4_tagbegin

m4_tag(dbenv, [The environment in which recovery is running.])
m4_tag(rec, [The record being recovered.])
m4_tag(lsn, [The log sequence number of the record being recovered.])
m4_tag(op, Unused.)
m4_tag(info, Unused.)

m4_tagend])

m4_p([dnl
Finally, the source file will contain a function (named XXX_init_print,
where XXX is replaced by the prefix) which should be added to the
initialization part of the standalone m4_ref(db_printlog) utility code
so that utility can be used to display application-specific log records.])
