m4_p([dnl
The application should include a dispatch function that dispatches to
appropriate printing and/or recovery functions based on the log record
type and the operation code.  The dispatch function should take the same
arguments as the recovery function, and should call the appropriate
recovery and/or printing functions based on the log record type and the
operation code.  For example, the ex_apprec dispatch function is as
follows:])

m4_indent([dnl
int
apprec_dispatch(dbenv, dbt, lsn, op)
	DB_ENV *dbenv;
	DBT *dbt;
	DB_LSN *lsn;
	db_recops op;
{
	u_int32_t rectype;

	/* Pull the record type out of the log record. */
	memcpy(&rectype, dbt-__GT__data, sizeof(rectype));

	switch (rectype) {
	case DB_ex_apprec_mkdir:
		return (ex_apprec_mkdir_recover(dbenv, dbt, lsn, op, NULL));
	default:
		/*
		 * We've hit an unexpected, allegedly user-defined record
		 * type.
		 */
		dbenv-__GT__errx(dbenv, "Unexpected log record type encountered");
		return (EINVAL);
	}
}
])

m4_p([dnl
Applications use this dispatch function and the automatically generated
functions as follows:])

m4_nlistbegin

m4_nlist([dnl
When the application starts, call the m4_ref(dbenv_set_app_dispatch)
with your dispatch function.])

m4_nlist([dnl
Issue a m4_ref(txn_begin) call before any operations you want to be
transaction-protected.])

m4_nlist([dnl
Before accessing any data, issue the appropriate lock call to lock the
data (either for reading or writing).])

m4_nlist([dnl
Before modifying any data that is transaction-protected, issue a call
to the appropriate log function.])

m4_nlist([dnl
Call m4_ref(txn_commit) to save all the changes, or call m4_ref(txn_abort)
to cancel all of the modifications.])

m4_nlistend

m4_p([dnl
The recovery functions are called in the three following cases:])

m4_nlistbegin
m4_nlist([dnl
During recovery after application or system failure, with op set to
m4_ref(DB_TXN_FORWARD_ROLL) or m4_ref(DB_TXN_BACKWARD_ROLL).])
m4_nlist([dnl
During transaction abort, with op set to m4_ref(DB_TXN_ABORT).])
m4_nlist([dnl
On a replicated client to apply updates from the master, with op set to
m4_ref(DB_TXN_APPLY).])
m4_nlistend

m4_p([dnl
For each log record type you declare, you must write the appropriate
function to undo and redo the modifications.  The shell of these
functions will be generated for you automatically, but you must fill in
the details.])

m4_p([dnl
Your code must be able to detect whether the described modifications
have been applied to the data.  The function will be called with the
"op" parameter set to m4_ref(DB_TXN_ABORT) when a transaction that wrote
the log record aborts, with m4_ref(DB_TXN_FORWARD_ROLL) and
m4_ref(DB_TXN_BACKWARD_ROLL) during recovery, and with m4_ref(DB_TXN_APPLY)
on a replicated client.])

m4_p([dnl
The actions for m4_ref(DB_TXN_ABORT) and m4_ref(DB_TXN_BACKWARD_ROLL)
should generally be the same, and the actions for
m4_ref(DB_TXN_FORWARD_ROLL) and m4_ref(DB_TXN_APPLY) should generally
be the same.  However, if the application is using m4_db replication
and another thread of control may be performing read operations while
log records are applied on a replication client, the recovery function
should perform appropriate locking during m4_ref(DB_TXN_APPLY)
operations.  In this case, the recovery function may encounter deadlocks
when issuing locking calls.  The application should run with the
deadlock detector, and the recovery function should simply return
m4_ref(DB_LOCK_DEADLOCK) if a deadlock is detected and a locking
operation fails with that error.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(DB_TXN_PRINT) operation should print the log record,
typically using the auto-generated print function; it is not used in
the m4_db library, but may be useful for debugging, as in the
m4_ref(db_printlog) utility.  Applications may safely ignore this
operation code, they may handle printing from the recovery function, or
they may dispatch directly to the auto-generated print function.])

m4_p([dnl
One common way to determine whether operations need to be undone or
redone is the use of log sequence numbers (LSNs).  For example, each
access method database page contains the LSN of the most recent log
record that describes a modification to the page.  When the access
method changes a page, it writes a log record describing the change and
including the LSN that was on the page before the change.  This LSN is
referred to as the previous LSN.  The recovery functions read the page
described by a log record, and compare the LSN on the page to the LSN
they were passed.])

m4_p([dnl
If the page LSN is less than the passed LSN and the operation is an
undo, no action is necessary (because the modifications have not been
written to the page).  If the page LSN is the same as the previous LSN
and the operation is a redo, the actions described are reapplied to the
page.  If the page LSN is equal to the passed LSN and the operation is
an undo, the actions are removed from the page; if the page LSN is
greater than the passed LSN and the operation is a redo, no further
action is necessary.  If the action is a redo and the LSN on the page
is less than the previous LSN in the log record, it is an error because
it could happen only if some previous log record was not processed.])

m4_p([dnl
Examples of other recovery functions can be found in the m4_db library
recovery functions (found in files named XXX_rec.c) and in the
application-specific recovery example (specifically, ex_apprec_rec.c).])

m4_p([dnl
Finally, applications need to ensure that any data modifications they
have made, that were part of a committed transaction, must be written
to stable storage before calling the m4_refT(txn_checkpoint).  This is
to allow the periodic removal of database environment log files.])
