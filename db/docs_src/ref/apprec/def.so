m4_ref_title(Application Specific Logging and Recovery,
    Defining application-specific log records,,
    apprec/intro, apprec/auto)

m4_p([dnl
By convention, log records are described in files named m4_path(XXX.src),
where "XXX" is typically a descriptive name for a subsystem or other
logical group of logging functions.  These files contain interface
definition language descriptions for each type of log record that is
used by the subsystem.])

m4_p([dnl
All blank lines and lines beginning with a hash ("[#]") character in
the XXX.src files are ignored.])

m4_p([dnl
The first non-comment line in the file should begin with the keyword
PREFIX, followed by a string that will be prepended to every generated
function name.  Frequently, the PREFIX is either identical or similar
to the name of the m4_path(XXX.src) file.  For example, the m4_db
application-specific recovery example uses the file
m4_path(ex_apprec.src), which begins with the following PREFIX line:])

m4_indent([PREFIX ex_apprec])

m4_p([dnl
Following the PREFIX line are the include files required by the
automatically generated functions.  The include files should be listed
in order, prefixed by the keyword INCLUDE.  For example, the m4_db
application-specific recovery example lists the following include
files:])

m4_indent([dnl
INCLUDE [#]include __LT__ctype.h__GT__
INCLUDE [#]include __LT__errno.h__GT__
INCLUDE [#]include __LT__stdlib.h__GT__
INCLUDE [#]include __LT__string.h__GT__
INCLUDE
INCLUDE [#]include __LT__db.h__GT__
INCLUDE
INCLUDE [#]include "ex_apprec.h"])

m4_p([dnl
The rest of the XXX.src file consists of log record descriptions.  Each
log record description begins with one of the following lines:])

m4_indent([BEGIN m4_italic(RECORD_NAME) m4_italic(DB_VERSION_NUMBER) m4_italic(RECORD_NUMBER)])
m4_indent([BEGIN_BUF m4_italic(RECORD_NAME) m4_italic(DB_VERSION_NUMBER)])
m4_indent([BEGIN_COMPAT m4_italic(RECORD_NAME) m4_italic(DB_VERSION_NUMBER) m4_italic(RECORD_NUMBER)])

m4_p([dnl
and ends with the line:])

m4_indent([END])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_italic(BEGIN) line should be used for most record types.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_italic(BEGIN_BUF) is used for records that need only marshalling and
unmarshalling of the record, that is logging and reading routines, but not
a recovery routine.  These records are specific to the replication system's
internal initialization process, which sends variable length records containing
file data and file description records.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_italic(BEGIN_COMPAT) is used for log record compatibility to facilitate
online upgrades of replication groups. Records created with this keyword will
produce reading and printing routines, but no logging routines.  The recovery
routines are retrieved from older releases, so no recovery templates will be
generated for these records.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_italic(DB_VERSION_NUMBER) variable should be replaced with the
current major and minor version of m4_db, with all punctuation removed.
For example, m4_db version 4.2 should be 42, version 4.5 should be 45.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_italic(RECORD_NAME) variable should be replaced with a record
name for this log record.  The m4_italic(RECORD_NUMBER) variable should
be replaced with a record number.])

m4_p([dnl
The combination of PREFIX name and m4_italic(RECORD_NAME), and the
m4_italic(RECORD_NUMBER) must be unique for the application, that is,
values for application-specific and m4_db log records may not overlap.
Further, because record numbers are stored in log files, which are
usually portable across application and m4_db releases, any change to
the record numbers or log record format or should be handled as
described in the m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/upgrade/process, Upgrading m4_db
installations) section on log format changes.  The record number space
below 10,000 is reserved for m4_db itself; applications should choose
record number values equal to or greater than 10,000.])

m4_p([dnl
Between the BEGIN and END keywords there should be one optional
m4_italic(DUPLICATE) line and one line for each
data item logged as part of this log record.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_italic(DUPLICATE) line is of the form:])

m4_indent([DUPLICATE m4_italic(RECORD_NAME) m4_italic(DB_VERSION_NUMBER) m4_italic(RECORD_NUMBER)])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_italic(DUPLICATE) specifier should be used when creating a record
that requires its own record number but can use the argument structure,
reading and printing routines from another record.  In this case, we will
create a new log record type, but use the enclosing log record type for
the argument structure and the log reading and printing routines.])

m4_p([dnl
The format of lines for each data item logged is as follows:])

m4_indent([dnl
ARG | DBT | POINTER	m4_italic(variable_name)	m4_italic(variable_type)	m4_italic(printf_format)])

m4_p([dnl
The keyword ARG indicates that the argument is a simple parameter of
the type specified. For example, a file ID might be logged as:])

m4_indent([dnl
ARG	fileID	int	d])

m4_p([dnl
The keyword DBT indicates that the argument is a m4_db DBT structure,
containing a length and pointer to a byte string.  The keyword POINTER
indicates that the argument is a pointer to the data type specified (of
course the data type, not the pointer, is what is logged).])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_italic(variable_name) is the field name within the structure that
will be used to refer to this item.  The m4_italic(variable_type) is
the C-language type of the variable, and the printf format is the
C-language format string, without the leading percent ("%") character,
that should be used to display the contents of the field (for example,
"s" for string, "d" for signed integral type, "u" for unsigned integral
type, "ld" for signed long integral type, "lu" for long unsigned
integral type, and so on).])

m4_p([dnl
For example, ex_apprec.src defines a single log record type, used to
log a directory name that has been stored in a DBT:])

m4_indent([dnl
BEGIN	mkdir		10000
DBT	dirname		DBT		s
END])

m4_p([dnl
As the name suggests, this example of an application-defined log record
will be used to log the creation of a directory.  There are many more
examples of XXX.src files in the m4_db distribution.  For example, the
file btree/btree.src contains the definitions for the log records
supported by the m4_db Btree access method.])
