Once you have started tclsh and have loaded the test.tcl source file
(see m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/build_unix/test, Running the test suite under
UNIX) and m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/build_win/test, Running the test suite
under Windows) for more information), you are ready to run the test
suite.  At the tclsh prompt, to run the standard test suite, enter the
following:])

m4_indent([% run_std])

m4_p([dnl
A more exhaustive version of the test suite runs all the tests several
more times, testing encryption, replication, and different page sizes.
After you have a clean run for run_std, you may choose to run this
lengthier set of tests.  At the tclsh prompt, enter:])

m4_indent([% run_all])

m4_p([dnl
Running the standard tests can take from several hours to a few days to
complete, depending on your hardware, and running all the tests will
take at least twice as long.  For this reason, the output from these
commands are redirected to a file in the current directory named
m4_path(ALL.OUT).  Periodically, a line will be written to the standard
output, indicating what test is being run.  When the test suite has
finished, a final message will be written indicating the test suite has
completed successfully or that it has failed.  If the run failed, you
should review the m4_path(ALL.OUT) file to determine which tests failed.
Errors will appear in that file as output lines, beginning with the
string "FAIL".])

m4_p([dnl
Tests are run in the directory m4_path(TESTDIR), by default.  However,
the test files are often large, and you should use a filesystem with at
least several hundred megabytes of free space.  To use a different
directory for the test directory, edit the file include.tcl in your
build directory, and change the following line to a more appropriate
value for your system:])

m4_indent([dnl
set testdir ./TESTDIR])

m4_p([dnl
For example, you might change it to the following:])

m4_indent([dnl
set testdir /var/tmp/db.test])

m4_p([dnl
Alternatively, you can create a symbolic link named TESTDIR in your
build directory to an appropriate location for running the tests.
Regardless of where you run the tests, the TESTDIR directory should be
on a local filesystem.  Using a remote filesystem (for example, an NFS
mounted filesystem) will almost certainly cause spurious test
failures.])
