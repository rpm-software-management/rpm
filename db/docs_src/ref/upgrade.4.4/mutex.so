m4_p([dnl
The DB_ENV__GT__set_tas_spins and DB_ENV__GT__get_tas_spins methods have
been renamed to m4_ref(mutex_set_tas_spins) and
m4_ref(mutex_get_tas_spins) to match the new mutex support in the m4_db
4.4 release.  Applications calling the old methods should be updated to
use the new method names.])

m4_p([dnl
For backward compatibility, the string "set_tas_spins" is still supported
in DB_CONFIG files.])

m4_p([dnl
The --with-mutexalign=ALIGNMENT compile-time configuration option has
been removed from m4_db configuration.  Mutex alignment should now be
configured at run-time, using the m4_refT(mutex_set_align).])
