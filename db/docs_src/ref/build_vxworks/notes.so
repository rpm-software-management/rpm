    VxWorks notes, @VxWorks notes, build_vxworks/intro, build_vxworks/faq)

m4_p([dnl
m4_db currently disallows the DB_TRUNC flag to m4_ref(dbh_open).  The
operations that this flag represents are not fully supported under
VxWorks.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(dbh_sync) function is implemented using an ioctl call into
the file system driver with the FIOSYNC command.  Most, but not all file
system drivers support this call.  m4_db requires the use of a file
system supporting FIOSYNC.])

m4_section([Building and Running the Demo Program])
m4_p([dnl
The demo program should be built in a manner very similar to
building m4_db.  If you want different or additional BSP
build specifications you should add them by following the
directions indicated in m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/build_vxworks/intro, Building
with Tornado 2.0 or Tornado 2.2).])

m4_p([dnl
The demo program can be downloaded and run by calling the entry function
m4_bold(dbdemo) with the pathname of a database to use.  The demo
program will ask for some input keys.  It creates a database and adds
those keys into the database, using the reverse of the key as the data
value.  When complete you can either enter EOF (control-D) or
m4_bold(quit) and the demo program will display all of the key/data
items in the database.])

m4_section([Building and Running the Utility Programs])
m4_p([dnl
The m4_db  m4_link(M4RELDIR/utility/index, utility programs)
can be downloaded and run by calling the
function equivalent to the utility's name.  The utility functions take
a string containing all the supported arguments.  The program will then
decompose that string into a traditional argc/argv used internally.
For example, to execute m4_ref(db_stat) on a database within an
environment you would execute the following from the windsh prompt.
Obviously you would change the pathname and database name to reflect
your system.])

m4_indent([-__GT__ db_stat "-h /tmp/myenvhome -d mydatabase.db"])

m4_section([Notes for VxWorks 5.4/5.5])
m4_p([dnl
The memory on VxWorks is always resident and fully shared among all
tasks running on the target.  For this reason, the m4_ref(DB_SYSTEM_MEM)
flag is implied for any application that does not specify the
m4_ref(DB_PRIVATE) flag.  Additionally, applications must use a segment
ID to ensure that different applications do not overwrite each other's
database environments.  See the m4_refT(dbenv_set_shm_key) for more
information.  Also, the m4_ref(DB_LOCKDOWN) flag has no effect.])

m4_p([dnl
A default small footprint build is provided.  This default provides
equivalent to the m4_arg(--enable-smallbuild) configuration option
described in m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/build_unix/small, Building a
small memory footprint library).  In order to build the small
footprint, you should move m4_path([db_config.h]) aside and copy
m4_path([db_config_small.h]) to m4_path([db_config.h]).  Then open up
the appropriate small workspace file via Tornado and build as usual.])
