Open the workspace m4_bold(BerkeleyDB20.wsp) or m4_bold(BerkeleyDB22.wsp).
The list of projects in this workspace will be shown.  These projects
were created for the x86 BSP for VxWorks.])

The remainder of this document assumes that you already have a VxWorks
target and a target server, both up and running.  It also assumes that
your VxWorks image is configured properly for your needs.  It also
assumes that you have an acceptable file system already available.
See m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/build_vxworks/faq, VxWorks FAQ) for more
information about file system requirements.
See m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/build_vxworks/notes, VxWorks Notes) for more
information about building a small footprint version of m4_db.])

First, you need to set the include directories.  To do this, go to the
m4_italic(Builds) tab for the workspace.  Open up m4_italic(m4_db
Builds).  You will see several different builds, containing different
configurations.  All of the projects in the m4_db workspace are created
to be downloadable applications.])

m4_p([dnl
You have to add a new build specification if you use a
different BSP, want to add a build for the simulator or
want to customize further.  For instance, if you have the Power PC (PPC)
BSP, you need to add a new build for the PPC tool chain.  To do so,
select the "Builds" tab, select the m4_db project name, and right-click.
Choose the m4_italic(New Build...) selection and create the new build
target.  For your new build target, you need to decide whether
it should be built for
debugging.  See the properties of the Pentium builds for ways to
configure for each case.  After you add this build you, you still need
to configure correctly the include directories, as described in the
sections that follow.])

m4_p([dnl
If you are running with a different
BSP, you should remove the build specifications that do not apply to
your hardware.  We recommend that you do this after you configure any
new build specifications first.  The Tornado tools will get confused if
you have a PENTIUMgnu build specification for a PPC BSP,
for instance.])

m4_p([dnl
Select the build you are interested in, and right-click.  Choose the
m4_italic(Properties...) selection.  At this point, a tabbed dialog
should appear.  In this new window, choose the m4_italic(C/C++ compiler)
tab.  In the edit box, you need to modify the full pathname of the
m4_italic(build_vxworks) subdirectory of m4_db, followed by the full
pathname of m4_db.  Then, click OK.
Note that some versions of Tornado (such as the version for Windows)
do not correctly handle relative pathnames in the include paths.])

To build and download the m4_db downloadable application for the first time
requires several steps: ])

m4_nlistbegin
m4_nlist([dnl
Select the build you are interested in, and right-click.  Choose the
m4_italic(Set... as Active Build) selection.])
m4_nlist([dnl
Select the build you are interested in, and right-click.  Choose the
m4_italic(Dependencies...) selection.  Run dependencies over all files
in the m4_db project.])
m4_nlist([dnl
Select the build you are interested in, and right-click.  Choose the
m4_italic(Rebuild All (m4_db.out)) selection.])
m4_nlist([dnl
Select the m4_db project name, and right-click.  Choose the
m4_italic(Download "m4_db.out") selection.])
m4_nlistend

m4_p([dnl
Note that the output file listed about will really be listed as
m4_italic(BerkeleyDB20.out) or m4_italic(BerkeleyDB22.out)
depending on which version of Tornado you are running.
You need to repeat this procedure for all builds you are interested in
building, as well as for all of the utility project builds you want to
run.])
