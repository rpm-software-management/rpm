m4_p([dnl
The Tcl API closely parallels the m4_db programmatic interfaces.  If you
are already familiar with one of those interfaces, there will not be many
surprises in the Tcl API.])

m4_p([dnl
The Tcl API currently does not support multithreading although
it could be made to do so.  The Tcl shell itself is
not multithreaded and the m4_db extensions use global data unprotected
from multiple threads.])

m4_p([dnl
Several pieces of m4_db functionality are not available in the Tcl API.
Any of the functions that require a user-provided function are not
supported via the Tcl API. For example, there is no equivalent to the
m4_refc(dbh_set_dup_compare) or the m4_refc(dbenv_set_errcall)
methods.])
