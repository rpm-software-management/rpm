m4_p([dnl
There are a few different issues to consider when tuning the performance
of m4_db transactional applications.  First, you should review
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/am_misc/tune, [Access method tuning]), as the
tuning issues for access method applications are applicable to
transactional applications as well.  The following are additional tuning
issues for m4_db transactional applications:])

m4_tagbegin
m4_tag(access method, [dnl
Highly concurrent applications should use the Queue access method, where
possible, as it provides finer-granularity of locking than the other
access methods.  Otherwise, applications usually see better concurrency
when using the Btree access method than when using either the Hash or
Recno access methods.])

m4_tag(record numbers, [dnl
Using record numbers outside of the Queue access method will often slow
down concurrent applications as they limit the degree of concurrency
available in the database.  Using the Recno access method, or the Btree
access method with retrieval by record number configured can slow
applications down.])

m4_tag(Btree database size, [dnl
When using the Btree access method, applications supporting concurrent
access may see excessive numbers of deadlocks in small databases.  There
are two different approaches to resolving this problem.  First, as the
Btree access method uses page-level locking, decreasing the database
page size can result in fewer lock conflicts.  Second, in the case of
databases that are cyclically growing and shrinking, turning off reverse
splits (with m4_ref(DB_REVSPLITOFF)) can leave the database with enough
pages that there will be fewer lock conflicts.])

m4_tag(read locks, [dnl
Performing all read operations outside of transactions or at
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/transapp/read, snapshot isolation) can often
significantly increase application throughput.  In addition, limiting
the lifetime of non-transactional cursors will reduce the length of
times locks are held, thereby improving concurrency.])

m4_tag([m4_ref(DB_DIRECT_DB), m4_ref(DB_DIRECT_LOG)], [dnl
Consider using the m4_ref(DB_DIRECT_DB) and m4_ref(DB_DIRECT_LOG) flags.
On some systems, avoiding caching in the operating system can improve
write throughput and allow the creation of larger m4_db caches.])

m4_tag([m4_ref(DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED), m4_ref(DB_READ_COMMITTED)], [dnl
Consider decreasing the level of isolation of transaction using the
m4_ref(DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED) or m4_ref(DB_READ_COMMITTED) flags for
transactions or cursors or the m4_ref(DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED) flag on
individual read operations.  The m4_ref(DB_READ_COMMITTED) flag will
release read locks on cursors as soon as the data page is nolonger
referenced.  This is also called m4_italic(degree 2 isolation).  This
will tend to block write operations for shorter periods for applications
that do not need to have repeatable reads for cursor operations.
m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(DB_READ_UNCOMMITTED) flag will allow read operations to
potentially return data which has been modified but not yet committed,
and can significantly increase application throughput in applications
that do not require data be guaranteed to be permanent in the database.
This is also called m4_italic(degree 1 isolation), or m4_italic(dirty
reads).])])

m4_tag([m4_ref(DB_RMW)], [dnl
If there are many deadlocks, consider using the m4_ref(DB_RMW) flag to
immediate acquire write locks when reading data items that will
subsequently be modified.  Although this flag may increase contention
(because write locks are held longer than they would otherwise be), it
may decrease the number of deadlocks that occur.])

m4_tag([m4_ref(DB_TXN_WRITE_NOSYNC), m4_ref(DB_TXN_NOSYNC)], [dnl
By default, transactional commit in m4_db implies durability, that is,
all committed operations will be present in the database after recovery
from any application or system failure.  For applications not requiring
that level of certainty, specifying the m4_ref(DB_TXN_NOSYNC) flag will
often provide a significant performance improvement. In this case, the
database will still be fully recoverable, but some number of committed
transactions might be lost after application or system failure.])

m4_tag(access databases in order, [dnl
When modifying multiple databases in a single transaction, always access
physical files and databases within physical files, in the same order
where possible.  In addition, avoid returning to a physical file or
database, that is, avoid accessing a database, moving on to another
database and then returning to the first database.  This can
significantly reduce the chance of deadlock between threads of
control.])

m4_tag(large key/data items, [dnl
Transactional protections in m4_db are guaranteed by before and after
physical image logging.  This means applications modifying large
key/data items also write large log records, and, in the case of the
default transaction commit, threads of control must wait until those
log records have been flushed to disk.  Applications supporting
concurrent access should try and keep key/data items small wherever
possible.])

m4_tag(mutex selection, [dnl
During configuration, m4_db selects a mutex implementation for the
architecture. m4_db normally prefers blocking-mutex implementations over
non-blocking ones.  For example, m4_db will select POSIX pthread mutex
interfaces rather than assembly-code test-and-set spin mutexes because
pthread mutexes are usually more efficient and less likely to waste CPU
cycles spinning without getting any work accomplished.
m4_p([dnl
For some applications and systems (generally highly concurrent
applications on large multiprocessor systems), m4_db makes the wrong
choice.  In some cases, better performance can be achieved by
configuring with the
m4_linkpage(M4RELDIR/ref/build_unix/conf, --with-mutex, --with-mutex)
argument and selecting a different mutex implementation than the one
selected by m4_db.  When a test-and-set spin mutex implementation is
selected, it may be useful to tune the number of spins made before
yielding the processor and sleeping.  For more information, see the
m4_refT(mutex_set_tas_spins).])
m4_p([dnl
Finally, m4_db may put multiple mutexes on individual cache lines.  When
tuning m4_db for large multiprocessor systems, it may be useful to tune
mutex alignment using the
m4_ref(mutex_set_align) method.])])

m4_tag([m4_linkpage(M4RELDIR/ref/build_unix/conf,
--enable-posixmutexes, --enable-posixmutexes)], [dnl
By default, the m4_db library will only select the POSIX pthread mutex
implementation if it supports mutexes shared between multiple processes.
If your application does not share its database environment between
processes and your system's POSIX mutex support was not selected because
it did not support inter-process mutexes, you may be able to increase
performance and transactional throughput by configuring with the
m4_linkpage(M4RELDIR/ref/build_unix/conf, --enable-posixmutexes,
--enable-posixmutexes) argument.])

m4_tag(log buffer size, [dnl
m4_db internally maintains a buffer of log writes.   The buffer is
written to disk at transaction commit, by default, or, whenever it
is filled.  If it is consistently being filled before transaction
commit, it will be written multiple times per transaction, costing
application performance.  In these cases, increasing the size of the
log buffer can increase application throughput.])

m4_tag(log file location, [dnl
If the database environment's log files are on the same disk as the
databases, the disk arms will have to seek back-and-forth between the
two.  Placing the log files and the databases on different disk arms
can often increase application throughput.])

m4_tag(trickle write, [dnl
In some applications, the cache is sufficiently active and dirty that
readers frequently need to write a dirty page in order to have space in
which to read a new page from the backing database file.  You can use
the m4_ref(db_stat) utility (or the statistics returned by the
m4_refT(memp_stat)) to see how often this is happening in your
application's cache.  In this case, using a separate thread of control
and the m4_refT(memp_trickle) to trickle-write pages can often increase
the overall throughput of the application.])
