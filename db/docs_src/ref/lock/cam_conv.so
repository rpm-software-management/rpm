m4_p([dnl
The m4_cam product has a simple set of conventions for locking.  It
provides multiple-reader/single-writer semantics, but not per-page
locking or transaction recoverability.  As such, it does its locking
entirely in the m4_db interface layer.])

m4_p([dnl
The object it locks is the file, identified by its unique file number.
The locking matrix is not one of the two standard lock modes, instead,
we use a four-lock set, consisting of the following:])

m4_tagbegin
m4_tag(DB_LOCK_NG, [not granted (always 0)])
m4_tagns(DB_LOCK_READ, [read (shared)])
m4_tagns(DB_LOCK_WRITE, [write (exclusive)])
m4_tagns(DB_LOCK_IWRITE, [intention-to-write (shared with NG and READ, but conflicts with WRITE and IWRITE)])
m4_tagend

m4_p([dnl
The IWRITE lock is used for cursors that will be used for updating
(IWRITE locks are implicitly obtained for write operations through the
m4_db handles, for example, m4_ref(dbh_put) or m4_ref(dbh_del)).  While
the cursor is reading, the IWRITE lock is held; but as soon as the
cursor is about to modify the database, the IWRITE is upgraded to a
WRITE lock.  This upgrade blocks until all readers have exited the
database.  Because only one IWRITE lock is allowed at any one time, no
two cursors can ever try to upgrade to a WRITE lock at the same time,
and therefore deadlocks are prevented, which is essential because m4_cam
does not include deadlock detection and recovery.])

m4_p([dnl
Applications that need to lock compatibly with m4_cam must obey the
following rules:])

m4_nlistbegin
m4_nlist([Use only lock modes DB_LOCK_NG, DB_LOCK_READ, DB_LOCK_WRITE,
DB_LOCK_IWRITE.])
m4_nlist([Never attempt to acquire a WRITE lock on an object that is
already locked with a READ lock.])
