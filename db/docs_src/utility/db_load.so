m4_idefz(utility to @load text files into databases)

m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(db_load) utility reads from the standard input and loads it
into the database m4_arg(file).  The database m4_arg(file) is created if
it does not already exist.])

m4_p([dnl
The input to m4_ref(db_load) must be in the output format specified by the
m4_ref(db_dump) utility, utilities, or as specified for the m4_option(T)
below.])

m4_p([The options are as follows:])

m4_tagbegin
m4_tagopt(c, [dnl
Specify configuration options ignoring any value they may have based on
the input.  The command-line format is m4_bold(name=value).  See the
Supported Keywords section below for a list of keywords supported by
the m4_option(c) option.])

m4_tagopt(f, [dnl
Read from the specified m4_arg(input) file instead of from the standard
input.])

m4_tagopt(h, [dnl
Specify a home directory for the database environment.
m4_p([dnl
If a home directory is specified, the database environment is opened
using the m4_ref(DB_INIT_LOCK), m4_ref(DB_INIT_LOG),
m4_ref(DB_INIT_MPOOL), m4_ref(DB_INIT_TXN), and m4_ref(DB_USE_ENVIRON)
flags to m4_ref(dbenv_open).  (This means that m4_ref(db_load) can be
used to load data into databases while they are in use by other
processes.) If the m4_ref(dbenv_open) call fails, or if no home
directory is specified, the database is still updated, but the
environment is ignored; for example, no locking is done.])])

m4_tagopt(n, [dnl
Do not overwrite existing keys in the database when loading into an
already existing database.  If a key/data pair cannot be loaded into the
database for this reason, a warning message is displayed on the standard
error output, and the key/data pair are skipped.])

m4_Pflag

m4_tagopt(r, [dnl
Reset the database's file ID or log sequence numbers (LSNs).
m4_p([dnl
All database pages in transactional environments contain references to
the environment's log records.  In order to copy a database into a
different database environment, database page references to the old
environment's log records must be reset, otherwise data corruption can
occur when the database is modified in the new environment.  The
m4_option(r) m4_arg(lsn) option resets a database's log sequence
numbers.])
m4_p([dnl
All databases contain an ID string used to identify the database in the
database environment cache.  If a database is copied, and used in the
same environment as another file with the same ID string, corruption can
occur.  The m4_option(r) m4_arg(fileid)  option resets a database's file
ID to a new value.])
m4_p([m4_bold([dnl
In both cases, the physical file specified by the m4_arg(file) argument
is modified in-place.])])])

m4_tagopt(T, [dnl
The m4_option(T) option allows non-m4_db applications to easily load text
files into databases.
m4_p([dnl
If the database to be created is of type Btree or Hash, or the keyword
m4_bold(keys) is specified as set, the input must be paired lines of text,
where the first line of the pair is the key item, and the second line of
the pair is its corresponding data item.  If the database to be created
is of type Queue or Recno and the keywork m4_bold(keys) is not set, the
input must be lines of text, where each line is a new data item for the
database.])
m4_p([dnl
A simple escape mechanism, where newline and backslash (m4_backslash())
characters are special, is applied to the text input.  Newline characters
are interpreted as record separators.  Backslash characters in the text
will be interpreted in one of two ways: If the backslash character
precedes another backslash character, the pair will be interpreted as a
literal backslash.  If the backslash character precedes any other
character, the two characters following the backslash will be interpreted
as a hexadecimal specification of a single character; for example,
m4_backslash(0a) is a newline character in the ASCII character set.])

m4_p([dnl
For this reason, any backslash or newline characters that naturally
occur in the text input must be escaped to avoid misinterpretation by
m4_ref(db_load).])
m4_p([dnl
If the m4_option(T) option is specified, the underlying access method type
must be specified using the m4_option(t) option.])])

m4_tagopt(t, [dnl
Specify the underlying access method.  If no m4_option(t) option is
specified, the database will be loaded into a database of the same type
as was dumped; for example, a Hash database will be created if a Hash
database was dumped.
m4_p([dnl
Btree and Hash databases may be converted from one to the other.  Queue
and Recno databases may be converted from one to the other.  If the
m4_bold(-k) option was specified on the call to m4_ref(db_dump) then Queue
and Recno databases may be converted to Btree or Hash, with the key being
the integer record number.])])

m4_detach(db_load, may be used with)

m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(db_load) utility exits 0 on success, 1 if one or more key/data
pairs were not loaded into the database because the key already existed,
and __GT__1 if an error occurs.])

m4_section(Examples)
m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(db_load) utility can be used to load text files into databases.
For example, the following command loads the standard UNIX
m4_italic(/etc/passwd) file into a database, with the login name as the
key item and the entire password entry as the data item:])

m4_indent([dnl
awk -F: '{print $1; print $0}' __LT__ /etc/passwd |
    sed 's/m4_backslash()m4_backslash()/m4_backslash()m4_backslash()m4_backslash()m4_backslash()/g' | db_load -T -t hash passwd.db])

m4_p([dnl
Note that backslash characters naturally occurring in the text are escaped
to avoid interpretation as escape characters by m4_ref(db_load).])

m4_section(Supported Keywords)
The following keywords are supported for the m4_option(c) command-line
option to the m4_ref(db_load) utility.  See m4_ref(dbh_open) for further
discussion of these keywords and what values should be specified.

m4_p([dnl
The parenthetical listing specifies how the value part of the
m4_bold(name=value) pair is interpreted.  Items listed as (boolean)
expect value to be m4_bold(1) (set) or m4_bold(0) (unset).  Items listed
as (number) convert value to a number.  Items listed as (string) use
the string value without modification.])
