m4_idefz(utility to @dump databases as text files)

m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(db_dump) utility reads the database file m4_arg(file) and
writes it to the standard output using a portable flat-text format
understood by the m4_ref(db_load) utility.  The m4_arg(file) argument
must be a file produced using the m4_db library functions.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(db_dump185) utility is similar to the m4_ref(db_dump) utility,
except that it reads databases in the format used by m4_db versions 1.85
and 1.86.])

m4_p([The options are as follows:])

m4_tagbegin

m4_tagopt(d, [dnl
Dump the specified database in a format helpful for debugging the m4_db
library routines.
m4_tagbegin
m4_tag(a, [Display all information.])
m4_tagns(h, [Display only page headers.])
m4_tagns(r, [Do not display the free-list or pages on the free list.  This
mode is used by the recovery tests.])
m4_tagend
m4_p([m4_bold([dnl
The output format of the m4_option(d) option is not standard and may change,
without notice, between releases of the m4_db library.])])])

m4_tagopt(f, [dnl
Write to the specified m4_arg(file) instead of to the standard output.])

m4_hflag

m4_tagopt(k, [Dump record numbers from Queue and Recno databases as keys.])

m4_tagopt(l, [List the databases stored in the file.])

m4_Nflag

m4_Pflag

m4_tagopt(p, [dnl
If characters in either the key or data items are printing characters (as
defined by m4_manref(isprint, 3)), use printing characters in m4_arg(file)
to represent them.  This option permits users to use standard text editors
and tools to modify the contents of databases.

m4_p([dnl
Note: different systems may have different notions about what characters
are considered m4_italic(printing characters), and databases dumped in
this manner may be less portable to external systems.])])

m4_tagopt(R, [dnl
Aggressively salvage data from a possibly corrupt file.  The m4_option(R)
flag differs from the m4_option(r) option in that it will return all
possible data from the file at the risk of also returning already deleted
or otherwise nonsensical items.  Data dumped in this fashion will almost
certainly have to be edited by hand or other means before the data is
ready for reload into another database])

m4_tagopt(r, [dnl
Salvage data from a possibly corrupt file.  When used on a uncorrupted
database, this option should return equivalent data to a normal dump, but
most likely in a different order.])

m4_tagopt(s, [dnl
Specify a single database to dump.  If no database is specified, all
databases in the database file are dumped.])

m4_Vflag

m4_tagend

m4_p([dnl
Dumping and reloading Hash databases that use user-defined hash
functions will result in new databases that use the default hash
function.  Although using the default hash function may not be optimal
for the new database, it will continue to work correctly.])

m4_p([dnl
Dumping and reloading Btree databases that use user-defined prefix or
comparison functions will result in new databases that use the default
prefix and comparison functions.
m4_bold([dnl
In this case, it is quite likely that the database will be damaged
beyond repair permitting neither record storage or retrieval.])])

m4_p([dnl
The only available workaround for either case is to modify the sources
for the m4_ref(db_load) utility to load the database using the correct
hash, prefix, and comparison functions.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(db_dump185) utility may not be available on your system
because it is not always built when the m4_db libraries and utilities
are installed.  If you are unable to find it, see your system
administrator for further information.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_ref(db_dump) and m4_ref(db_dump185) utility output formats are
documented in the m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/dumpload/format, [Dump Output
Formats]) section of the m4_db Reference Guide.])

m4_detach(db_dump, may be used with)

m4_p([dnl
Even when using a m4_db database environment, the m4_ref(db_dump)
utility does not use any kind of database locking if it is invoked with
the m4_bold(-d), m4_bold(-R), or m4_bold(-r) arguments.   If used with
one of these arguments, the m4_ref(db_dump) utility may only be safely
run on databases that are not being modified by any other process;
otherwise, the output may be corrupt.])
