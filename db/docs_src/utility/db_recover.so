m4_italic(snapshot) -- of all database files must be restored along with
all of the log files written since the database file snapshot was made.

links).  For further information on creating a database snapshot, see

further information on performing recovery, see

log file(s) and fail, in which case the missing log files need to be
restored and recovery performed again.])
