m4_parambegin
m4_param(envid, [dnl
The m4_arg(envid) parameter is the local environment's ID.  It must be
a non-negative integer and uniquely identify this m4_db database environment
(see m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/rep/id, Replication environment IDs) for more
information).])

m4_param(send, [dnl
The m4_arg(send) callback function is used to transmit data using the
replication application's communication infrastructure.  The parameters
to m4_arg(send) are as follows:

m4_tagbegin
m4_tag(m4_arg(dbenv), [dnl
The m4_arg(dbenv) parameter is the enclosing database environment handle.])
m4_tag(m4_arg(control), [dnl
The m4_arg(control) parameter is the first of the two data elements to be
transmitted by the m4_arg(send) function.])
m4_tag(m4_arg(rec), [dnl
The m4_arg(rec) parameter is the second of the two data elements to be
transmitted by the m4_arg(send) function.])
m4_tag(m4_arg(lsnp), [dnl
If the type of message to be sent has an LSN associated with it, then
the m4_arg(lsnp) parameter contains the LSN of the record being sent.
This LSN can be used to determine that certain records have been
processed successfully by clients.])
m4_tag(m4_arg(envid), [dnl
The m4_arg(envid) parameter is a positive integer identifier that
specifies the replication environment to which the message should be
sent (see m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/rep/id, Replication environment IDs) for
more information).
m4_idefz(DB_EID_BROADCAST)
m4_p([dnl
The special identifier m4_ref(DB_EID_BROADCAST) indicates that a message
should be broadcast to every environment in the replication group.  The
application may use a true broadcast protocol or may send the message
in sequence to each machine with which it is in communication.  In both
cases, the sending site should not be asked to process the message.])])
m4_tag(m4_arg(flags), [m4_sf_or_may
m4_tagbegin
m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_REP_ANYWHERE), [dnl
The message is a client request that can be satisfied by another client
as well as by the master.])
m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_REP_NOBUFFER), [dnl
The record being sent should be transmitted immediately and not buffered
or delayed.])
m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_REP_PERMANENT), [dnl
The record being sent is critical for maintaining database integrity
(for example, the message includes a transaction commit).  The
application should take appropriate action to enforce the reliability
guarantees it has chosen, such as waiting for acknowledgement from one
or more clients.])
m4_tag(m4_idef(DB_REP_REREQUEST), [dnl
The message is a client request that has already been made and to which
no response was received.])

m4_p([dnl
It may sometimes be useful to pass application-specific data to the
m4_arg(send) function; see m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/env/faq, Environment
FAQ) for a discussion on how to do this.])

m4_p([dnl
The m4_arg(send) function must return 0 on success and non-zero on
failure.  If the m4_arg(send) function fails, the message being sent is
necessary to maintain database integrity, and the local log is not
configured for synchronous flushing, the local log will be flushed;
otherwise, any error from the m4_arg(send) function will be ignored.])
