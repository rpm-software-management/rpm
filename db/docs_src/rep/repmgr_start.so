m4_p([dnl
There are two ways to build m4_db replication applications: the most
common approach is to use the m4_db library "replication manager"
support, where the m4_db library manages the replication group,
including network transport, all replication message processing and
acknowledgment, and group elections.  Applications using the replication
manager support generally make the following calls:])

m4_nlistbegin
m4_nlist([dnl
Call m4_ref(repmgr_set_local_site) to configure the local site in the
replication group.])

m4_nlist([dnl
Call m4_ref(repmgr_add_remote_site) to configure the remote site(s) in
the replication group.])

m4_nlist([dnl
Call m4_ref(repmgr_set_ack_policy) to configure the message
acknowledgment policy which provides the replication group's
transactional needs.])

m4_nlist([dnl
Call m4_ref(rep_set_priority) to configure the local site's election
priority.])

m4_nlist([dnl
Call m4_ref(repmgr_start) to start the replication application.])

m4_nlistend

please see the "Replication Manager Getting Started Guide" included in
the m4_db documentation.])

m4_p([dnl
Applications with special needs (for example, applications using network
protocols not supported by the m4_db replication manager), must perform
additional configuration and call other m4_db replication methods.  For
more information on building advanced replication applications, please
see the "Advanced Replication Applications Guide" included in the m4_db
documentation.])
