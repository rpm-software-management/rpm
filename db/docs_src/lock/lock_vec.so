Cause the specified m4_arg(locker) to timeout immediately.  If the
database environment has not configured automatic deadlock detection,
the transaction will timeout the next time deadlock detection is
performed.  As transactions acquire locks on behalf of a single locker
ID, timing out the locker ID associated with a transaction will time
out the transaction itself.])
