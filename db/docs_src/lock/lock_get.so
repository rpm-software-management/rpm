m4_param(lock_mode, [dnl
The m4_arg(lock_mode) parameter is used as an index into the environment's
lock conflict matrix.  When using the default lock conflict matrix,
m4_arg(lock_mode) must be set to one of the following values:
m4_tagbegin
m4_tagns(DB_LOCK_READ, [read (shared)])
m4_tagns(DB_LOCK_WRITE, [write (exclusive)])
m4_tagns(DB_LOCK_IWRITE, [intention to write (shared)])
m4_tagns(DB_LOCK_IREAD, [intention to read (shared)])
m4_tagns(DB_LOCK_IWR, [intention to read and write (shared)])
m4_tagend

See m4_ref(dbenv_set_lk_conflicts) and m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/lock/stdmode,
[Standard Lock Modes]) for more information on the lock conflict matrix.])])

m4_param(locker, [dnl
The m4_arg(locker) parameter is an unsigned 32-bit integer quantity.  It
represents the entity requesting the lock.])

m4_param(object, [dnl
The m4_arg(object) parameter is an untyped byte string that specifies the
object to be locked.  Applications using the locking subsystem directly
while also doing locking via the m4_db access methods must take care not
to inadvertently lock objects that happen to be equal to the unique file
IDs used to lock files.  See
m4_link(M4RELDIR/ref/lock/am_conv, [Access method locking conventions])
for more information.])
