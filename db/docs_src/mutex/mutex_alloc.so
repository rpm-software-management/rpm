The mutex must be self-blocking.  That is, if a thread of control locks
the mutex and then attempts to lock the mutex again, the thread of
control will block until another thread of control releases the original
lock on the mutex, allowing the original thread of control to lock the
mutex the second time.  Attempting to re-acquire a mutex for which the
m4_ref(DB_MUTEX_SELF_BLOCK) flag was not specified will result in
undefined behavior.])
