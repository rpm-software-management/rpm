<h2>Access Sample</h2>

<p>This sample demonstrates a minimal program that uses the BDB API of
Berkeley DB.</p>

<p>This example tries to mirror exactly the AccessExample using the old
API and found implemented for each of the other APIs (C and C++).  By
taking a look at the differences between this implementation and the
one found in <code>../../db/AccessExample.java</code> you can start to
see some of the advantages of using the BDB API.

<p>See <a href="../index.html">samples/db/index.html</a> for information
on how to compile and run the samples.</p>
