Generally requests for new features should be opened as a [Discussion](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/rpm/discussions) first. There feedback from the community can be collected and possible solutions can be discussed. Consider maintaining a design outline in the top post and update it as the discussion progresses. After a plan of action has solidified an issue for actually implementing it can be created.
