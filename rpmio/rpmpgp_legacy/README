This is the former internal RPM OpenPGP parser, decommissioned
after twenty years of service.

This parser is considered insecure: it simply ignores various critical
aspects of OpenPGP, such as sub-packet binding signatures and takes
various other questionable shortcuts.

This is not a standalone project, it can only be built as a part of RPM.
To build, check this repository into the rpmio/ directory of RPM's
sources and re-run cmake with `-DWITH_SEQUOIA=OFF -DWITH_LEGACY_OPENPGP=ON`

Use entirely at your own risk, the RPM project does not provide support
for this parser.
