.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrpm\fR is a powerful \fBPackage Manager\fR,
which can be used to build, install, query, verify, update, and
erase individual software packages.
A \fBpackage\fR consists of an archive of files and
meta-data used to install and erase the archive files. The meta-data
includes helper scripts, file attributes, and descriptive information
about the package.
\fBPackages\fR come in two varieties: binary packages,
used to encapsulate software to be installed, and source packages,
containing the source code and recipe necessary to produce binary
packages.
.PP
One of the following basic modes must be selected:
\fBQuery\fR,
\fBVerify\fR,
\fBInstall/Upgrade/Freshen\fR,
\fBUninstall\fR,
\fBSet Owners/Groups\fR,
\fBShow Querytags\fR, and
\fBShow Configuration\fR.
.SS "GENERAL OPTIONS"
.PP
These options can be used in all the different modes.
.TP
\fB-?, --help\fR
Print a longer usage message then normal.
.TP
\fB--version\fR
Print a single line containing the version number of \fBrpm\fR
being used. 
.TP
\fB--quiet\fR
Print as little as possible - normally only error messages will
be displayed.
.TP
\fB-v\fR
Print verbose information - normally routine progress messages will be
displayed.
.TP
\fB-vv\fR
Print lots of ugly debugging information.
.TP
\fB--rcfile \fIFILELIST\fB\fR
Each of the files in the colon separated
\fIFILELIST\fR
is read sequentially by \fBrpm\fR for configuration
information.
Only the first file in the list must exist, and tildes will be
expanded to the value of \fB$HOME\fR.
The default \fIFILELIST\fR is
\fI/usr/lib/rpm/rpmrc\fR:\fI/usr/lib/rpm/redhat/rpmrc\fR:\fI/etc/rpmrc\fR:\fI~/.rpmrc\fR.
.TP
\fB--pipe \fICMD\fB\fR
Pipes the output of \fBrpm\fR to the command \fICMD\fR.
.TP
\fB--dbpath \fIDIRECTORY\fB\fR
Use the database in \fIDIRECTORY\fR rather
than the default path \fI/var/lib/rpm\fR
.TP
\fB--root \fIDIRECTORY\fB\fR
Use the file system tree rooted at \fIDIRECTORY\fR for all operations.
Note that this means the database within
\fIDIRECTORY\fR
will be used for dependency checks and any scriptlet(s) (e.g.
\fB%post\fR if installing, or
\fB%prep\fR if building, a package)
will be run after a chroot(2) to
\fIDIRECTORY\fR.
.TP
\fB-D, --define='\fIMACRO EXPR\fB'\fR
Defines \fIMACRO\fR with value \fIEXPR\fR.
.TP
\fB-E, --eval='\fIEXPR\fB'\fR
Prints macro expansion of \fIEXPR\fR.
.SS "INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS"
.PP
In these options, \fIPACKAGE_FILE\fR can be either \fBrpm\fR binary
file or ASCII package manifest (see \fBPACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS\fR), and
may be specified as an
\fBftp\fR or
\fBhttp\fR URL,
in which case the package will be downloaded before being
installed. See \fBFTP/HTTP OPTIONS\fR
for information on \fBrpm\fR's internal
\fBftp\fR and
\fBhttp\fR
client support.
.PP
The general form of an rpm install command is 
.PP
\fBrpm\fR {\fB-i|--install\fR} [\fBinstall-options\fR] \fB\fIPACKAGE_FILE\fB\fR\fI ...\fR
.PP
This installs a new package.
.PP
The general form of an rpm upgrade command is 
.PP
\fBrpm\fR {\fB-U|--upgrade\fR} [\fBinstall-options\fR] \fB\fIPACKAGE_FILE\fB\fR\fI ...\fR
.PP
This upgrades or installs the package currently installed
to a newer version.  This is the same as install, except
all other version(s) of the package are removed after the
new package is installed.
.PP
\fBrpm\fR {\fB-F|--freshen\fR} [\fBinstall-options\fR] \fB\fIPACKAGE_FILE\fB\fR\fI ...\fR
.PP
This will upgrade packages, but only ones for which an earlier version is
installed.
.PP
.TP
\fB--allfiles\fR
Installs or upgrades all the missingok files in the package,
regardless if they exist.
.TP
\fB--badreloc\fR
Used with \fB--relocate\fR, permit relocations on
all file paths, not just those \fIOLDPATH\fR's
included in the binary package relocation hint(s).
.TP
\fB--excludepath \fIOLDPATH\fB\fR
Don't install files whose name begins with
\fIOLDPATH\fR.
.TP
\fB--excludedocs\fR
Don't install any files which are marked as documentation
(which includes man pages and texinfo documents).
.TP
\fB--force\fR
Same as using
\fB--replacepkgs\fR,
\fB--replacefiles\fR, and
\fB--oldpackage\fR.
.TP
\fB-h, --hash\fR
Print 50 hash marks as the package archive is unpacked.
Use with \fB-v|--verbose\fR for a nicer display.
.TP
\fB--ignoresize\fR
Don't check mount file systems for sufficient disk space before
installing this package.
.TP
\fB--ignorearch\fR
Allow installation or upgrading even if the architectures
of the binary package and host don't match.
.TP
\fB--ignoreos\fR
Allow installation or upgrading even if the operating
systems of the binary package and host don't match.
.TP
\fB--includedocs\fR
Install documentation files. This is the default behavior.
.TP
\fB--justdb\fR
Update only the database, not the filesystem.
.TP
\fB--nodigest\fR
Don't verify package or header digests when reading.
.TP
\fB--nomanifest\fR

.TP
\fB--nopre\fR
.TP
\fB--nopost\fR
.TP
\fB--nopreun\fR
.TP
\fB--nopostun\fR

The \fB--noscripts\fR option is equivalent to

\fB--nopre\fR
\fB--nopost\fR
\fB--nopreun\fR
\fB--nopostun\fR

and turns off the execution of the corresponding
\fB%pre\fR,
\fB%post\fR,
\fB%preun\fR, and
\fB%postun\fR
scriptlet(s).
.TP
\fB--notriggers\fR
.TP
\fB--notriggerin\fR
.TP
\fB--notriggerun\fR
.TP
\fB--notriggerprein\fR
.TP
\fB--notriggerpostun\fR

The \fB--notriggers\fR option is equivalent to

\fB--notriggerprein\fR
\fB--notriggerin\fR
\fB--notriggerun\fR
\fB--notriggerpostun\fR

and turns off execution of the corresponding
\fB%triggerprein\fR,
\fB%triggerin\fR,
\fB%triggerun\fR, and

scriptlet(s).
.TP
\fB--oldpackage\fR
Allow an upgrade to replace a newer package with an older one.
.TP
\fB--percent\fR
Print percentages as files are unpacked from the package archive.
This is intended to make \fBrpm\fR easy to run from
other tools.
.TP
\fB--prefix \fINEWPATH\fB\fR
For relocatable binary packages, translate all file paths that
start with the installation prefix in the package relocation hint(s)
to \fINEWPATH\fR.
.TP
\fB--relocate \fIOLDPATH\fB=\fINEWPATH\fB\fR
For relocatable binary packages, translate all file paths
that start with \fIOLDPATH\fR in the
package relocation hint(s) to \fINEWPATH\fR.
This option can be used repeatedly if several
\fIOLDPATH\fR's in the package are to
be relocated.
.TP
\fB--replacefiles\fR
Install the packages even if they replace files from other,
already installed, packages.
.TP
\fB--replacepkgs\fR
Install the packages even if some of them are already installed
on this system.

.SS "ERASE OPTIONS"
.PP
The general form of an rpm erase command is 
.PP

\fBrpm\fR {\fB-e|--erase\fR} [\fB--allmatches\fR] [\fB--nodeps\fR] [\fB--noscripts\fR] [\fB--notriggers\fR] [\fB--test\fR] \fB\fIPACKAGE_NAME\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.PP
The following options may also be used:
.TP
\fB--allmatches\fR

\fIPACKAGE_NAME\fR. Normally an
error is issued if \fIPACKAGE_NAME\fR
matches multiple packages.
.TP
\fB--nodeps\fR
Don't check dependencies before uninstalling the packages.
.TP
\fB--noscripts\fR
.TP
\fB--nopreun\fR
.TP
\fB--nopostun\fR
Don't execute the scriptlet of the same name.
The \fB--noscripts\fR option during package erase is
equivalent to

\fB--nopreun\fR
\fB--nopostun\fR

and turns off the execution of the corresponding
\fB%preun\fR, and
\fB%postun\fR
scriptlet(s).
.TP
\fB--notriggers\fR
.TP
\fB--notriggerun\fR
.TP
\fB--notriggerpostun\fR
Don't execute any trigger scriptlet of the named type.
The \fB--notriggers\fR option is equivalent to

\fB--notriggerun\fR
\fB--notriggerpostun\fR

and turns off execution of the corresponding
\fB%triggerun\fR, and
\fB%triggerpostun\fR
scriptlet(s).
.TP
\fB--test\fR
Don't really uninstall anything, just go through the motions.
Useful in conjunction with the \fB-vv\fR option
for debugging.
.SS "QUERY OPTIONS"
.PP
The general form of an rpm query command is 
.PP

\fBrpm\fR {\fB-q|--query\fR} [\fBselect-options\fR] [\fBquery-options\fR]

.PP
You may specify the format that package information should be
printed in. To do this, you use the

 \fB--qf|--queryformat\fR \fB\fIQUERYFMT\fB\fR

option, followed by the \fIQUERYFMT\fR
format string.  Query formats are modified versions of the
standard \fBprintf(3)\fR formatting. The format
is made up of static strings (which may include standard C
character escapes for newlines, tabs, and other special
characters) and \fBprintf(3)\fR type formatters.
As \fBrpm\fR already knows the type to print, the
type specifier must be omitted however, and replaced by the name
of the header tag to be printed, enclosed by \fB{}\fR
characters. Tag names are case insensitive, and the leading
\fBRPMTAG_\fR portion of the tag name may be omitted
as well.
.PP
Alternate output formats may be requested by following
the tag with \fB:\fItypetag\fB\fR.
Currently, the following types are supported:
.TP
\fB:armor\fR
Wrap a public key in ASCII armor.
.TP
\fB:arraysize\fR
Display number of elements in array tags.
.TP
\fB:base64\fR
Encode binary data using base64.
.TP
\fB:date\fR
Use strftime(3) "%c" format.
.TP
\fB:day\fR
Use strftime(3) "%a %b %d %Y" format.
.TP
\fB:depflags\fR
Format dependency comparison operator.
.TP
\fB:deptype\fR
Format dependency type.
.TP
\fB:expand\fR
Perform macro expansion.
.TP
\fB:fflags\fR
Format file flags.
.TP
\fB:fstate\fR
Format file state.
.TP
\fB:fstatus\fR
Format file verify status.
.TP
\fB:hex\fR
Format in hexadecimal.
.TP
\fB:octal\fR
Format in octal.
.TP
\fB:perms\fR
Format file permissions.
.TP
\fB:pgpsig\fR
Display signature fingerprint and time.
.TP
\fB:shescape\fR
Escape single quotes for use in a script.
.TP
\fB:triggertype\fR
Display trigger suffix.
.TP
\fB:vflags\fR
File verification flags.
.TP
\fB:xml\fR
Wrap data in simple xml markup.
.PP
For example, to print only the names of the packages queried,
you could use \fB%{NAME}\fR as the format string.
To print the packages name and distribution information in
two columns, you could use \fB%-30{NAME}%{DISTRIBUTION}\fR.
\fBrpm\fR will print a list of all of the tags it knows about when it
is invoked with the \fB--querytags\fR argument.
.PP
There are two subsets of options for querying: package selection,
and information selection.
.SS "PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS:"
.PP
.TP
\fB\fIPACKAGE_NAME\fB\fR
Query installed package named \fIPACKAGE_NAME\fR.
.TP
\fB-a, --all\fR
Query all installed packages.
.TP
\fB-f, --file \fIFILE\fB\fR
Query package owning \fIFILE\fR.
.TP
\fB-g, --group \fIGROUP\fB\fR
Query packages with the group of \fIGROUP\fR.
.TP
\fB--hdrid \fISHA1\fB\fR
Query package that contains a given header identifier, i.e. the
\fISHA1\fR digest of the immutable header region.
.TP
\fB-p, --package \fIPACKAGE_FILE\fB\fR
Query an (uninstalled) package \fIPACKAGE_FILE\fR.
The \fIPACKAGE_FILE\fR may be specified
as an \fBftp\fR or \fBhttp\fR style URL, in
which case the package header will be downloaded and queried.
See \fBFTP/HTTP OPTIONS\fR for information on
\fBrpm\fR's internal
\fBftp\fR and
\fBhttp\fR
client support. The \fIPACKAGE_FILE\fR argument(s),
if not a binary package, will be interpreted as an ASCII package
manifest unless \fB--nomanifest\fR option is used.  
In manifests, comments are permitted, starting with a '#', and each
line of a package manifest file may include white space separated
glob expressions, including URL's,
that will be expanded to paths that are substituted in place of
the package manifest as additional \fIPACKAGE_FILE\fR
arguments to the query.
.TP
\fB--pkgid \fIMD5\fB\fR
Query package that contains a given package identifier, i.e. the
\fIMD5\fR digest of the combined header and
payload contents.
.TP
\fB--querybynumber \fIHDRNUM\fB\fR
Query the \fIHDRNUM\fRth database entry
directly; this is useful only for debugging.
.TP
\fB--specfile \fISPECFILE\fB\fR
Parse and query \fISPECFILE\fR as if
it were a package. Although not all the information (e.g. file lists)
is available, this type of query permits rpm to be used to extract
information from spec files without having to write a specfile
parser.
.TP
\fB--tid \fITID\fB\fR
Query package(s) that have a given \fITID\fR
transaction identifier. A unix time stamp is currently used as a
transaction identifier. All package(s) installed or erased within
a single transaction have a common identifier.
.TP
\fB--triggeredby \fIPACKAGE_NAME\fB\fR
Query packages that are triggered by package(s)
\fIPACKAGE_NAME\fR.
.TP
\fB--whatprovides \fICAPABILITY\fB\fR
Query all packages that provide the \fICAPABILITY\fR capability.
.TP
\fB--whatrequires \fICAPABILITY\fB\fR
Query all packages that require \fICAPABILITY\fR for proper functioning.
.SS "PACKAGE QUERY OPTIONS:"

This uses the \fB--queryformat\fR if one was specified.
.TP
\fB--last\fR
Orders the package listing by install time such that the latest
packages are at the top.
.TP
\fB-l, --list\fR
List files in package.
.TP
\fB--obsoletes\fR
List packages this package obsoletes.
.TP
\fB--provides\fR
List capabilities this package provides.
.TP
\fB-R, --requires\fR
List capabilities on which this package depends.
.TP
\fB--scripts\fR
List the package specific scriptlet(s) that are used as part
of the installation and uninstallation processes.
.TP
\fB-s, --state\fR
Display the \fIstates\fR of files in the package
(implies \fB-l\fR).  The state of each file is one of
\fInormal\fR,
\fInot installed\fR, or
\fIreplaced\fR.
.TP
\fB--triggers, --triggerscripts\fR
Display the trigger scripts, if any, which are contained in
the package.
.SS "VERIFY OPTIONS"
.PP
The general form of an rpm verify command is 
.PP

\fBrpm\fR {\fB-V|--verify\fR} [\fBselect-options\fR] [\fBverify-options\fR]

.PP
Verifying a package compares information about the installed files in
the package with information about the files taken from the package
metadata stored in the rpm database.  Among other things, verifying
compares the size, digest, permissions, type, owner and group of
each file.  Any discrepancies are displayed.
Files that were not installed from the package, for example,
documentation files excluded on installation using the
"\fB--excludedocs\fR" option,
will be silently ignored.
.PP
The package selection options are the same as for package
querying (including package manifest files as arguments).
Other options unique to verify mode are:
.TP
\fB--nodeps\fR
Don't verify dependencies of packages.
.TP
\fB--nodigest\fR
Don't verify package or header digests when reading.
.TP
\fB--nofiles\fR
Don't verify any attributes of package files.
.TP
\fB--noscripts\fR
Don't execute the \fB%verifyscript\fR scriptlet (if any).
.TP
\fB--nosignature\fR
Don't verify package or header signatures when reading.
.TP
\fB--nolinkto\fR
.TP
\fB--nofiledigest\fR (formerly \fB--nomd5\fR)
.TP
\fB--nosize\fR
.TP
\fB--nouser\fR
.TP
\fB--nogroup\fR
.TP
\fB--nomtime\fR
.TP
\fB--nomode\fR
.TP
\fB--nordev\fR
Don't verify the corresponding file attribute.
.PP
The format of the output is a string of 9 characters, a possible
attribute marker:

.nf
\fBc\fR \fB%config\fR configuration file.
\fBd\fR \fB%doc\fR documentation file.
\fBg\fR \fB%ghost\fR file (i.e. the file contents are not included in the package payload).
\fBl\fR \fB%license\fR license file.
\fBr\fR \fB%readme\fR readme file.
.fi

from the package header, followed by the file name.
Each of the 9 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s) recorded
in the database.  A single
"\fB.\fR" (period)
means the test passed, while a single
"\fB?\fR" (question mark)
indicates the test could not be performed (e.g. file permissions
prevent reading). Otherwise, the (mnemonically
em\fBB\fRoldened) character denotes failure of
the corresponding \fB--verify\fR test:

.nf
\fBS\fR file \fBS\fRize differs
\fBM\fR \fBM\fRode differs (includes permissions and file type)
\fB5\fR digest (formerly MD\fB5\fR sum) differs
\fBD\fR \fBD\fRevice major/minor number mismatch
\fBL\fR read\fBL\fRink(2) path mismatch
\fBU\fR \fBU\fRser ownership differs
\fBG\fR \fBG\fRroup ownership differs
\fBT\fR m\fBT\fRime differs
\fBP\fR ca\fBP\fRabilities differ
.fi

.SS "SHOWRC"
.PP
The command
.PP
\fBrpm\fR \fB--showrc\fR
.PP
shows the values \fBrpm\fR will use for all of the
options are currently set in
\fIrpmrc\fR and
\fImacros\fR
configuration file(s).
.SS "FTP/HTTP OPTIONS"
.PP
\fBrpm\fR can act as an FTP and/or HTTP client so
that packages can be queried or installed from the internet.
Package files for install, upgrade, and query operations may be
specified as an
\fBftp\fR or
\fBhttp\fR
style URL:  
.PP
ftp://USER:PASSWORD@HOST:PORT/path/to/package.rpm
.PP
If the \fB:PASSWORD\fR portion is omitted, the password will be
prompted for (once per user/hostname pair). If both the user and
password are omitted, anonymous \fBftp\fR is used.
In all cases, passive (PASV) \fBftp\fR transfers are
performed.
.PP
\fBrpm\fR allows the following options to be used with
ftp URLs:
.TP
\fB--ftpproxy \fIHOST\fB\fR
The host \fIHOST\fR will be used as a proxy server
for all ftp transfers, which allows users to ftp through firewall
machines which use proxy systems. This option may also be specified
by configuring the macro \fB%_ftpproxy\fR.
.TP
\fB--ftpport \fIPORT\fB\fR
The TCP \fIPORT\fR number to use for
the ftp connection on the proxy ftp server instead of the default
port. This option may also be specified by configuring the macro
\fB%_ftpport\fR.
.PP
\fBrpm\fR allows the following options to be used with
\fBhttp\fR URLs:
.TP
\fB--httpproxy \fIHOST\fB\fR
The host \fIHOST\fR will be used as
a proxy server for all \fBhttp\fR transfers. This
option may also be specified by configuring the macro
\fB%_httpproxy\fR.
.TP
\fB--httpport \fIPORT\fB\fR
The TCP \fIPORT\fR number to use for the
\fBhttp\fR connection on the proxy http server instead
of the default port. This option may also be specified by configuring
the macro \fB%_httpport\fR.

executable. 
Install the package containing \fBrpmbuild\fR (usually \fBrpm-build\fR) and see
\fBrpmbuild\fR(8) for documentation of all the \fBrpm\fR build modes.
