.SH NAME
rpmcache \- Cache RPM Package Headers
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP


\fBrpmcache\fR [ \fB\fIPACKAGE_NAME\fB\fR\fI ...\fR ]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrpmcache\fR walks a file tree, possibly remotely using
\fBFTP\fR, filtering paths using
\fBglob\fR(7) expressions, reading
rpm package headers. The latest (i.e. comparing
package epoch/version/release for identical package
names and using the build time as a tie breaker) package
headers, if they are unique, are cached in an rpm database.
The rpm database cache can be used to provide suggested
paths to packages that resolve unknown dependencies.
.PP
There are no \fBrpmcache\fR specific options, only common \fBrpm\fR options.
See the \fBrpmcache\fR usage message for what is currently implemented.
.PP
The file tree path to be searched is configured using rpm
macros. The final path is the concatentaion of 5 individual
elements. Here are the macro names used to configure \fBrpmcache\fR, in
the same order that they will be concatenated to build the
file tree path that will be walked:
.PP
.TP
\fB%_bhpath\fR
The "path" level contains the leading part of the file tree path
(or URL) for the file tree to be walked.
No \fBglob\fR(7) expressions, here, please.
.TP
\fB%_bhcoll\fR
The "collection" level contains a string (or
\fBglob\fR(7) expression) to match sub-directories of
\fB%_bhpath\fR.
.TP
\fB%_bhN\fR
The "name" level contains a string (or
\fBglob\fR(7) expression) to match sub-directories of
\fB%_bhcoll\fR.
The \fIPACKAGE_NAME\fR
arguments are used to construct a \fBglob\fR(7)
expression that will match any of specific package names within
the Red Hat build system, and are almost certainly not of use to
anyone outside of Red Hat.
.TP
\fB%_bhVR\fR
The "version-release" level contains a string (or
\fBglob\fR(7) expression) to match sub-directories of
\fB%_bhN\fR.
.TP
\fB%_bhA\fR
The "arch" level contains a string (or
\fBglob\fR(7) expression) to match sub-directories of
\fB%_bhVR\fR.
.PP
The location of the cache database is also configured using
an rpm macro:
.TP
\fB%_cache_dbpath\fR
The location of the cache database. The default value is
\fI/var/spool/up2date/cache\fR.
.PP
The cache database is identical in format to an rpm database,
and can be used with \fBrpm\fR from the command line. For example,
to use the cache database to provide suggestions for packages
that provide dependencies needed by a package install, the following
macro should be configured in either
\fI/etc/rpm/macros\fR or
\fI~/.rpmmacros\fR:
.TP
\fB%_sdbpath\fR
The location of the database that is used to provide
suggested dependency resolutions.
