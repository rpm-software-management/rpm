.\" rpm2archive - Converts Red Hat Package (RPM) to tar archive
.TH RPM2ARCHIVE 8 "27 January 2020" "Red Hat, Inc."
.SH NAME
rpm2archive \- Create tar archive from RPM Package Manager (RPM) package.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBrpm2archive\fP [filename] 
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBrpm2archive\fP converts the .rpm files specified as arguments to gz
compressed tar files with suffix ".tgz".

If '-' is given as argument, an rpm stream is read from standard in and
written to standard out.

In opposite to \fBrpm2cpio\fP \fBrpm2archive\fP also works with RPM packages
containing files greater than 4GB which are not supported by cpio. Unless
\fBrpm2cpio\fP \fBrpm2archive\fP needs a working rpm installation which limits
its usefulness for some disaster recovery scenarios.
