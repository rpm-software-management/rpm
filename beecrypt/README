Welcome to version 3.0.0 of BeeCrypt:

AES support has been added, and the library has been thoroughly debugged,
with the addition of unit tests. Once you've built the library, you can
verify the correct functioning with 'make check'.

Multi-precision integer routines should now perform dramatically better 
an 64-bit processors, especially Alpha and Itanium.

Benchmarks can be obtained with 'make bench'.

As usual, your comments are welcome.



About BeeCrypt:

This library is an ongoing project of Virtual Unlimited B.V. Its goal is
to provide strong and fast cryptography for use by our products, but
we're not limiting the use to that. We're releasing it under the LGPL
license, because we feel that cryptography should be open to inspection
by everybody, and available for use by everybody to safeguard privacy.

Note that depending on where you are, the use of cryptography may be
limited or forbidden by law. Before using this library, make sure you
are legally entitled to do so.

Most of the algorithms are implemented from reliable sources such as:

"Handbook of Applied Cryptography"
 Alfred J. Menezes, Paul C. van Oorschot, Scott A. Vanstone
 CRC Press

"Applied Cryptography", second edition
 Bruce Schneier
 Wiley


For crypto enthusiasts these books are invaluable background material.

IEEE P1363 "Standard Specifications for Public Key Cryptography" is a
very interesting draft standard, which we will try to comply with.

The structures in the library are geared towards exchange with Java
and its security and cryptography classes. This library can also be
accessed from Java by installing BeeCrypt for Java, a JCE 1.2 crypto
provider and the counterpart of this library.


Included in the library are:
    - entropy sources for initializing pseudo-random generators
    - pseudo-random generators: FIPS-186, Mersenne Twister
    - block ciphers: AES, Blowfish
    - hash functions: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256
    - keyed hash functions: HMAC-MD5, HMAC-SHA-1, HMAC-SHA-256
    - multi-precision integer library, with assembler-optimized routines
      for several processors
    - probabilistic primality testing, with optimized small prime trial
      division
    - discrete logarithm parameter generation over a prime field
    - Diffie-Hellman key agreement
    - DSA signature scheme
    - ElGamal signature scheme (two variants)
    - RSA keypair generation with chinese remainder theorem variables
    - RSA public & private key operations
    - DHAES encryption scheme

Planned for the near future are:
    - compliance with and compliance statements for IEEE P1363
    - more blockciphers (Twofish, ... )
	- more hash functions (RIPEMD-160, SHA-384, SHA-512, HAVAL, Tiger)
	- RSA signatures as specified by RFC-2440.
	- Elliptic Curves (ECDSA, ... )
    - more blockcipher modes (OFB, ... )

The library has been tested on the following platforms:
	- AIX 5.1 ppc
	- AIX 5.1 ppc64
    - FreeBSD 4.0 alpha
    - FreeBSD 4.0, 4.2 x86
    - Linux glibc 2.x alpha
    - Linux glibc 2.x arm
	- Linux glibc 2.x ia64
    - Linux glibc 2.x ppc
    - Linux glibc 2.x sparc
    - Linux glibc 2.x x86
    - Solaris 2.6/2.7/2.8/2.9 sparc (with Forte or gnu compilers)
    - Solaris 2.7/2.8 x86 (with Forte or GNU compilers)
    - Tru64 Unix alpha
    - Win32 (Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0, 2000, XP)

The library is currently in the process of being ported to:
    - Darwin (apparently Apple has decided to change the PPC assembler format;
      this will need a fix)
    - Cygwin (Can't seem to get the DLL to build properly with the current
      version of the autotools)
    - HP/UX is a pain in the backside; I'll try getting it working, but the
      configure script doesn't seem capable of properly detecting gettimeofday.
