/*! \mainpage BeeCrypt API Documentation.

BeeCrypt started its life when the need for a portable and fast cryptography
library arose at Virtual Unlimited in 1997. I'm still trying to make it
faster, easier to use and more portable, in addition to providing better
documentation. The library is currently in full swing again, thanks to the
Beeyond Software Holding BV.

Legal disclaimer: note that depending on where you are, the use of
cryptography may be limited or forbidden by law. Before using this library,
make sure you are legally entitled to do so.

Included in the library are:
<ul>
 <li>entropy sources for initializing pseudo-random generators
 <li>pseudo-random generators
  <ul>
   <li>FIPS-186
  </ul>
 <li>block ciphers
  <ul>
   <li>AES
   <li>Blowfish
  </ul>
 <li>hash functions
  <ul>
   <li>MD5
   <li>SHA-1
   <li>SHA-256
  </ul>
 <li>keyed hash functions (a.k.a. message authentication codes)
  <ul>
   <li>HMAC-MD5
   <li>HMAC-SHA-1
   <li>HMAC-SHA-256
  </ul>
 <li>multi-precision integer library, with assembler-optimized routines
     for a range of processors; optimized to perform well on both 32-bit
     and 64-bit machines; uses Barrett modular reduction instead of the
     more common usual Montgomery algorithm; also implements sliding
     windows.
 <li>probabilistic primality testing, with optimized small prime trial
     division
 <li>discrete logarithm parameter generation over a prime field
 <li>Diffie-Hellman key agreement
 <li>DHAES encryption scheme
 <li>DSA signature scheme
 <li>ElGamal signature scheme (two variants)
 <li>RSA keypair generation with chinese remainder theorem variables
 <li>RSA public & private key operations
</ul>

A new feature in version 4.x is the C++ API, built to resemble Java's security
and cryptography API. At this moment the number of classes provided is just
enough to build CSPs. If there is enough interest, we may expand this library.

Planned for the future are:
<ul>
 <li>compliance with and compliance statements for IEEE P1363
 <li>more blockciphers (Twofish, ... )
 <li>more blockcipher modes (CTR, OFB, ... )
 <li>more hash functions (RIPEMD-160, SHA-384, SHA-512, HAVAL, Tiger)
 <li>RSA signatures as specified by RFC-2440.
 <li>Elliptic Curves (ECDSA, ... )
</ul>

The library has been tested on the following platforms:
<ul>
 <li>Darwin
 <li>Linux glibc 2.x alpha
 <li>Linux glibc 2.x arm
 <li>Linux glibc 2.x ia64
 <li>Linux glibc 2.x m68k
 <li>Linux glibc 2.x ppc
 <li>Linux glibc 2.x s390x
 <li>Linux glibc 2.x sparc
 <li>Linux glibc 2.x x86
 <li>Linux glibc 2.x x86_64
 <li>Solaris 2.[6789] sparc (with Forte or GNU compilers)
 <li>Solaris 2.[78] x86 (with Forte or GNU compilers)
 <li>Tru64 Unix alpha
 <li>Win32 (Windows 95, 98, NT 4.0, 2000, XP)
</ul>

The library is currently in the process of being ported to:
<ul>
 <li>AIX (shared libraries don't seem to work in 64-bit mode)
 <li>Cygwin (the DLL builds now, but needs to be tested)
</ul>

The structures in the library are geared towards exchange with Java
and its security and cryptography classes. This library can also be
accessed from Java by installing BeeCrypt for Java, a JCE 1.2 crypto
provider and the counterpart of this library.
