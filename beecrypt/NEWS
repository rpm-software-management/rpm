	  migrated to new calling sequence. The code now implements the method
	  described in IEEE P.1363.

	  results.
	- Fixed a bug in mprshiftlsz, which didn't work correctly when size = 1.

	- Fixed problem in the C version of mp32sub where carry would sometimes be missed. This was pointed out by Jon Sturgeon.
	- Revised entropy gathering system to do timeouts & asynchronous I/O where possible, to avoid hangs in case there's no noise on the audio device (i.e. digital silence), or when no data is available on devices such as /dev/random.
	- Changed mp32opt i386 assembler routines for slight performance improvement.
	- Changed mp32opt powerpc assembler routines for slight performance improvement.

	- Started writing the long-awaited documentation.

	- Added configure --disable-optimized option (disables assembler & processor-specific optimizations).
	- Fixed bug in SHA-1 assembler code for Pentium, where local variables were used below the current stack pointer; this could cause a problem if the routine was interrupted. This was pointed out by Richard Clayton.
	- Fixed bug in (certain cases of) modular inverse computation.
	- Fixed buffer overrun in base64 encoding. This was pointed out by Jon Sturgeon.
	- Fixed various minor bugs.
	- Renamed text files to match automake conventions.
