Known problems/bugs in neon                                      -*- text -*-
---------------------------

* 2818 requires that a on rejection of the SSL server cert, a "bad certificate"
 message should be sent - this is not being done currently (and can probably
 only be done with OpenSSL by actually doing cert verification in the verify
 callback)

* ne_lock_discover does not handle multiple (shared) locks on
  a single resource.

* SSL session caching issues; only cache for clean shutdowns, and
 only cache on shutdown, since the SSL_SESSION may change during
 an ne_session.

* what is passed as 'path' to req create hook: auth needs Request-URI;
  how does that interact with proxies?  also they will be passed NULL
  for a CONNECT request, or "*" possibly as well.

* expect100 support is broken.

* It would be nice to fail with a friendly error message if a client
cert is requested by the srever but one is not provided.  Currently,
returning -1 from the provide_client_cert function would allow that
(as it forces the SSL handshake to fail), but that would prevent
opportunistic use of client certificates, of the "SSLVerifyClient
optional" variety.
