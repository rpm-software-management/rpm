Perl-RPM - Native bindings to the RPM Package Manager API for Perl

Version 0.1 (first alpha)


WHAT IS IT

The Perl-RPM package is an attempt to provide Perl-level access to the complete
application programming interface that is a part of the RPM Package Manager
(RPM). Rather than have scripts rely on executing RPM commands and parse the
resultant output, this modules aims to provide Perl programmers the ability
to do anything that would otherwise have been done in C or C++.

The interface is being designed and laid out as a collection of classes, at
least some of which are also available as tied-hash implementations.

At this time, the interface only provides access to the database of installed
packages, and header data retrieval for RPM and SRPM files not yet installed.


BUILDING/INSTALLING

This package is set up to configure and build like a typical Perl extension.
To build:

        perl Makefile.PL
        make && make test

If the RPM package passes all tests, then:

        make install

You may need super-user access to install.
