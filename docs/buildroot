BUILD ROOT
==========

The build root is very similar to Root: (which will be deprecated
soon).  By using Buildroot: in your spec file you are indicating
that your package can be built (installed into and packaged from)
a user-definable directory.  This helps package building by normal
users.

The Spec File
-------------

Simply use

  Buildroot: <dir>

in your spec file.  The acutal buildroot used by RPM during the
build will be available to you (and your %prep, %build, and %install
sections) as the environment variable RPM_BUILD_ROOT.  You must
make sure that the files for the package are installed into the
proper buildroot.  As with Root:, the files listed in the %files
section should *not* contain the buildroot.  For example, the
following hypothetical spec file:

  Name: foo
  ...
  Root: /tmp
  
  %prep
  ...
  
  %build
  ...
  
  %install
  install -m755 fooprog /tmp/usr/bin/fooprog
  
  %files
  /usr/bin/fooprog

would be changed to:

  Name: foo
  ...
  Buildroot: /tmp
  
  %prep
  ...
  
  %build
  ...
  
  %install
  install -m755 fooprog $RPM_BUILD_ROOT/usr/bin/fooprog
  
  %files
  /usr/bin/fooprog

Building With a Build Root
--------------------------

RPM will use the buildroot listed in the spec file as the default
buildroot.  There are two ways to override this.  First, you can
have "buildroot: <dir>" in your rpmrc.  Second, you can override
the default, and any entry in an rpmrc by using "--buildroot <dir>"
on the RPM command line.
