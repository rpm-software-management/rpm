title: rpm.org - Documentation
---

This is the in-tree documentation of RPM. It is meant to blend into
the project's home page at [https://rpm.org](https://rpm.org).

There are two separate sets of documents here:

* [RPM's man pages](man/index.md)
* [RPM's Reference Manual](manual/index.md)

The API documention is also build here. But if you see this it is probably not built yet. 
If it is built (in-tree) it can be found [here](librpm/html/index.html).

The API documentation for the release can be found on [rpm.org's Documentation page](https://rpm.org/documentation.html)
