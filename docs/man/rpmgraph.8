.SH NAME
rpmgraph \- Display RPM Package Dependency Graph
.SH SYNOPSIS
.PP


\fBrpmgraph\fR \fB\fIPACKAGE_FILE\fB\fR\fI ...\fR

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
\fBrpmgraph\fR uses \fIPACKAGE_FILE\fR arguments
to generate a package dependency graph. Each
\fIPACKAGE_FILE\fR argument is read and
added to an rpm transaction set. The elements of the transaction
set are partially ordered using a topological sort. The partially
ordered elements are then printed to standard output.
.PP
Nodes in the dependency graph are package names, and edges in the
directed graph point to the parent of each node. The parent node
is defined as the last predecessor of a package when partially ordered
using the package dependencies as a relation. That means that the
parent of a given package is the package's last prerequisite.
.PP
The output is in \fBdot\fR(1) directed graph format,
and can be displayed or printed using the \fBdotty\fR
graph editor from the \fBgraphviz\fR package.
There are no \fBrpmgraph\fR specific options, only common \fBrpm\fR options.
See the \fBrpmgraph\fR usage message for what is currently implemented.
