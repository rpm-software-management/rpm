# DESCRIPTION
*rpm* is a powerful *Package Manager*, which can be used to build,
install, query, verify, update, and erase individual software packages.
A *package* consists of an archive of files and meta-data used to
install and erase the archive files. The meta-data includes helper
scripts, file attributes, and descriptive information about the package.
*Packages* come in two varieties: binary packages, used to encapsulate
software to be installed, and source packages, containing the source
code and recipe necessary to produce binary packages.

# OPERATIONS
## Querying and verifying packages
*-V*,
*--verify*
	Verify package(s), comparing information about the installed files in
	the package with information about the files taken from the package
	metadata stored in the *rpm* database. Among other things, verifying
	compares the size, digest, permissions, type, owner and group of each
	file. Any discrepancies are displayed.

*-q*,
*--query*
	Query package files or installed package(s).

## Installing, upgrading and removing packages
*-i*,
*--install*
	Install new package(s) without considering upgrade scenarios.
	This is considered special usage, normally installations should
	be done with *--upgrade*.

*-U*,
*--upgrade*
	Install or upgrade package(s) to a newer version. Old and/or
	obsoleted package(s) are removed after the new package is installed.

*-F*,
*--freshen*
	Upgrade package(s), but only ones for which an earlier version
	is installed.

*--reinstall*
	Reinstall previously installed package(s).

*--restore*
	Restore file metadata such as timestamp, owner, group,
	permissions and capabilities of files of installed package(s).

*-e*,
*--erase*
	Erase installed packages.

*-K*
	Verify the file contents against included checksums to ensure
	the contents haven't been modified. If the package is signed
	with a GPG key, rpm will validate the signature against the
	keys installed on the system.

## Misc operations
*--querytags*
	Dump known querytags. Useful with the *--queryformat* option.

See *rpm-common*(8) for the operations common to all rpm executables.

# ARGUMENTS
_PACKAGE_FILE_
	Either an *rpm* package or an *rpm-manifest*(5) file. May also be
	specified as an *ftp* or *http* URL, in which case the package will
	be downloaded before being installed. See *FTP/HTTP OPTIONS* for
	information on *rpm*'s *ftp* and *http* client support.

_PACKAGE_NAME_
	Installed package named _PACKAGE_NAME_. To specify the
	package more precisely the package name may be followed by the
	version or version and release both separated by a dash or an
	architecture name separated by a dot. See the output of *rpm -qa*
	or *rpm -qp* _PACKAGE_FILE_ as an example.

# OPTIONS
See *rpm-common*(8) for the options common to all operations.

# INSTALL AND UPGRADE OPTIONS
*--allfiles*
	Installs or upgrades all the *missingok* files in the package,
	regardless if they exist.

*--badreloc*
	Used with *--relocate*, permit relocations on all file paths, not
	just those _OLDPATH_'s included in the binary package relocation
	hint(s).

*--excludepath* _OLDPATH_
	Don't install files whose name begins with _OLDPATH_.

*--excludeartifacts*
	Don't install any files which are marked as artifacts, such as
	build-id links.

	Do not install configuration files.

*--excludedocs*
	Don't install any files which are marked as documentation (which
	includes man pages and texinfo documents).

*--force*
	Same as using *--replacepkgs*, *--replacefiles*, and
	*--oldpackage*.

*--ignoresize*
	Don't check mount file systems for sufficient disk space before
	installing this package.

*--ignorearch*
	Allow installation or upgrading even if the architectures of the
	binary package and host don't match.

*--ignoreos*
	Allow installation or upgrading even if the operating systems of the
	binary package and host don't match.

*--includedocs*
	Install documentation files. This is the default behavior.

*--nocontexts*
	Don't set SELinux contexts for files and scriptlets.
	Only effective if *rpm-plugin-selinux*(8) is installed
	and active.

*--nocaps*
	Don't set file capabilities.

*--noverify*
	Don't perform verify package files prior to installation.

*--nosysusers*
	Don't create sysusers from packages

*--oldpackage*

*--prefix* _NEWPATH_
	For relocatable binary packages, translate all file paths that start
	with the installation prefix in the package relocation hint(s) to
	_NEWPATH_.

*--relocate* _OLDPATH_=_NEWPATH_
	For relocatable binary packages, translate all file paths that start
	with _OLDPATH_ in the package relocation hint(s) to _NEWPATH_. This
	option can be used repeatedly if several _OLDPATH_'s in the package
	are to be relocated.

*--replacefiles*
	Install the packages even if they replace files from other, already
	installed, packages.

*--replacepkgs*
	Install the packages even if some of them are already installed on
	this system.

# ERASE OPTIONS
*--allmatches*
	Remove all versions of the package which match _PACKAGE_NAME_.
	Normally an error is issued if _PACKAGE_NAME_ matches multiple
	packages.

# TRANSACTION OPTIONS
The transaction options are common to *--install*, *--upgrade*,
*--reinstall* and *--erase* operations.

*--deploops*
	Print dependency loops as warnings.

*-h*, *--hash*

*--nodb*
	Update only the filesystem, not the database.

*--nodeps*
	Don't check dependencies before uninstalling the packages.

*--noorder*
	Don't reorder the packages for an install. The list of packages
	would normally be reordered to satisfy dependencies.

*--noplugins*

*--notriggerprein*
*--notriggerpostun*
	Disable execution of the trigger scriptlets of the named type.

*--percent*
	Print percentages as files are unpacked from the package archive.
	This is intended to make *rpm* easy to run from other tools.

	Useful in conjunction with the *-vv* option for debugging.

# QUERY OPTIONS
*--qf* _QUERYFMT_,
*--queryformat* _QUERYFMT_
	Output format of each queried package, as described by
	*rpm-queryformat*(7). If omitted, uses the format defined by

There are three subsets of options for querying: package selection, file
selection and information selection.

# PACKAGE SELECTION OPTIONS
*-a*, *--all* [_SELECTOR_ ...]
	Query all installed packages.

	Optional _SELECTOR_'s in the form of tag=pattern can be provided to
	narrow the selection, for example name="b\*" to query packages whose
	name starts with "b".

*--dupes*
	List duplicated packages.

*-f*, *--file* _FILE_
	Query package owning installed _FILE_.

*--filecaps*
	List file names with POSIX1.e capabilities.

*--fileclass*
	List file names with their classes (libmagic classification).

*--filecolor*
	List file names with their colors (0 for noarch, 1 for 32bit, 2 for
	64 bit).

*--fileprovide*
	List file names with their provides.

*--filerequire*

	Multiple packages may own a _PATH_, but the file is only owned by the
	package installed last.

*--querybynumber* _HDRNUM_
	Query the _HDRNUM_ database entry directly; this is useful only
	for debugging.

*--specfile* _SPECFILE_
	Obsolete, use *rpmspec*(1) instead.

*--tid* _TID_
	Query package(s) that have a given _TID_ transaction identifier. A
	UNIX time stamp is currently used as a transaction identifier. All
	package(s) installed or erased within a single transaction have a
	common identifier.

*--triggeredby* _PACKAGE_NAME_
	Query packages that are triggered by package(s) _PACKAGE_NAME_.

*--whatobsoletes* _CAPABILITY_

# VERIFY OPTIONS

The package and file selection options are the same as for package
querying (including *rpm-manifest*(5) files as arguments).
Other options unique to verify mode are:

*--nodeps*
	Don't verify dependencies of packages.

*--nodigest*
	Don't verify package or header digests when reading.

*--nofiles*
	Don't verify any attributes of package files.

*--noscripts*
	Don't execute the *%verifyscript* scriptlet (if any).

*--nosignature*
	Don't verify package or header signatures when reading.

*--nolinkto*
*--nofiledigest* (formerly *--nomd5*)
*--nosize*
*--nomtime*
*--nomode*
*--nordev*
	Don't verify the corresponding file attribute.

*--nouser*
*--nogroup*
	Don't verify file user/group ownership. Note that only local
	*passwd*(5) and *group*(5) databases are consulted.

*--nocaps*
	Don't verify file capabilities.

# OUTPUT
*--verify*
	The format of the output is a string of 9 _result_ characters
	a possible _attribute_ from the package, followed by the file name.

	Each of the 9 characters denotes the result of a comparison of
	attribute(s) of the file to the value of those attribute(s)
	recorded in the database.

	A single "*.*" (period) means the test passed, while a single
	"*?*" (question mark) indicates the test could not be performed
	(e.g. file permissions prevent reading). Otherwise, the (mnemonically
	em*B*oldened) character denotes failure of the corresponding
	*--verify* test:

# EXIT STATUS
On success, 0 is returned, a non-zero failure code otherwise.

# EXAMPLES
*rpm -Uvh hello-2.0-1.noarch.rpm*
	Install or upgrade _hello-2.0-1.noarch.rpm_ package with verbose output
	and progress meters. *-Uvh* is probably the most common of all
	the *rpm* operations.

*rpm -Uvh --excludedocs --root /srv/test mydist-23.mft*
	Install packages described by the _mydist-23.mft_ *rpm-manifest*(5)
	file into the alternative system root at _/srv/test_, excluding
	all documentation files.

*rpm -Fvh \*.rpm*
	Freshen installed packages from a local directory, with verbose
	output and progress meters.

*rpm -i kernel-6.15.4-200.x86_64.rpm*
	Install _kernel-6.15.4-200.x86_64.rpm_ package quietly. On some
	Linux distributions, different kernel versions are intended to be
	installed in parallel like this, _without_ erasing older ones to
	ensure there's a bootable kernel in case of problems. It's one
	of the few cases where *-i* is the right thing to use.

*rpm -evh --allmatches libhello*
	Erase all versions of package *libhello* on the system, with
	verbose output and progress meters. Typically there is only one
	version of a package installed at a time, but in some cases it's
	possible to have different versions or different architectures
	of a package installed in parallel, in which case *--allmatches*
	can be handy.

*rpm -vh --reinstall hello-2.0-1.noarch.rpm*
	Reinstall previously installed _hello-2.0-1.noarch.rpm_ package,
	with verbose output and progress labels.
	Useful if eg. the files of a package get corrupted or
	erased accidentally.

*rpm -v --restore --all*
	Restore permissions of files in all installed packages to their
	packaged specifications, with verbose output.

*rpm --verify --noconfig openssh-server*
	Verify the integrity of the installed *openssh-server* package,
	ignoring changes in configuration.

*rpm -qa*
	List all installed packages, using the default formatting.

*rpm -qlv --noartifact glibc*
	List the files of the *glibc* package in style similar to
	*ls*(1) command output with *ls -l*, omitting "artifact" files
	such as build-id's which are not usually the main interest.

*rpm -q --qf "[%{filenames} %{filedigests}\\n]" openssh-server*
	List file names and their corresponding digests of installed
	*openssh-server* package.

*rpm -qp --scripts --triggers --filetriggers myserver-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm*
	Show all scriptlets and triggers from the _myserver-1.0-1.x86_64.rpm_
	package file. Before installing unknown packages, at least do this!

*rpm --target ppc64le --eval "%optflags"*
	Print the expansion of the *%optflags* macro for the *ppc64le*
	architecture.
